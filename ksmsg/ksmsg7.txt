Nov 08, 2018 10:08pm
Rameen Rana

Rameen Rana

Rameen Rana

Nov 08, 2018 10:07pm
Rameen Rana
which i thought they would and do
Nov 08, 2018 10:07pm
Rameen Rana

Nov 08, 2018 10:07pm
Rameen Rana

Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Rameen Rana
i think id know who wins
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Rameen Rana
also the sophomore boys vs. sonya vismaya sanika and fatima
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Kevin Stephen
now that you have an email discussion i think you'll get more thoughtful votes
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Rameen Rana
you'd be surprised
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Rameen Rana
judging by these votes
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Rameen Rana
no
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Kevin Stephen
oh yeah for sure
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Kevin Stephen
especially the sophomore boys
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Rameen Rana
oh really???
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah if you brought this up at a board meeting you'd just get people rallying to akash's side
Nov 08, 2018 10:06pm
Kevin Stephen
hm i mean like
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Rameen Rana
i mean it would've been a trainwreck in person too but like
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Rameen Rana
should've said no
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Rameen Rana
fuck
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Rameen Rana
did we fuck up
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Kevin Stephen
soo like this will be a few days lol
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Kevin Stephen
our web page for endorsements is not ready
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Kevin Stephen
also
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Kevin Stephen
ok this is not bad thougha
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Kevin Stephen
SAME
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Rameen Rana
i cant wait to have no leadership positions anymore
Nov 08, 2018 10:05pm
Rameen Rana
i hate veerything
Nov 08, 2018 10:04pm
Rameen Rana
i feel bad for not doing this in person but they wanted endorsements out faster, I should've just said no but i really didnt think it'd be a big deal...
Nov 08, 2018 10:04pm
Rameen Rana
this stresses me otu so much
Nov 08, 2018 10:04pm
Rameen Rana
ugh
Nov 08, 2018 10:04pm
Rameen Rana
okay its not that bad
Nov 08, 2018 10:04pm
Kevin Stephen
maybe i will reply to this increasingly dramatic email thread
Nov 08, 2018 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
when's this due
Nov 08, 2018 10:01pm
Rameen Rana
Valid
Nov 08, 2018 9:59pm
Kevin Stephen
bc i'm working with them so bring almost as much bias to this as like Fatima
Nov 08, 2018 9:51pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm just trying to think through this
Nov 08, 2018 9:51pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah i know
Nov 08, 2018 9:50pm
Rameen Rana
and like trying not to be too biased as her best friend, it just doesnt make sense to me why we wouldnt endorse someone like her
Nov 08, 2018 9:50pm
Rameen Rana
like in confidence right
Nov 08, 2018 9:50pm
Rameen Rana
ya
Nov 08, 2018 9:50pm
Kevin Stephen
these are valid points
Nov 08, 2018 9:50pm
Rameen Rana
its interesting there have never been such drama about oliticization about saa
Nov 08, 2018 9:49pm
Rameen Rana
and I agree with that to be honest, and yes we're an umbrella organization but that doesn't mean we as a baord shouldn't endorse someone who has literally carried ac pol for the past 2 years
Nov 08, 2018 9:49pm
Rameen Rana
because she was the last super active member of baord
Nov 08, 2018 9:48pm
Kevin Stephen
that makes sense
Nov 08, 2018 9:48pm
Rameen Rana
so like Shaiba for example was the only candidate saa has endorsed in past years
Nov 08, 2018 9:48pm
Rameen Rana
honestly like precedecce is that SAA endorses a candidate if they were a productive member of board
Nov 08, 2018 9:48pm
Kevin Stephen
yes yes in confidence
Nov 08, 2018 9:47pm
Kevin Stephen
but also i could care less about UC elections
Nov 08, 2018 9:47pm
Kevin Stephen
clearly i am biased bc i'm literally on their campaign team
Nov 08, 2018 9:47pm
Rameen Rana
Do you mean what‚Äôs my opinion?
Nov 08, 2018 9:47pm
Kevin Stephen
i feel like akash and div are making some valid points
Nov 08, 2018 9:47pm
Rameen Rana
Thank uuu
Nov 08, 2018 9:47pm
Kevin Stephen

Nov 08, 2018 8:59pm
Rameen Rana

Nov 08, 2018 3:57pm
Rameen Rana

Rameen Rana

Nov 07, 2018 11:36pm
Kevin Stephen
at least one of these people MUST be sending this to arnav and nadine

Kevin Stephen

Nov 07, 2018 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen
"maybe if they didn't waste their time doing all this shit they'd have a working website"
Nov 07, 2018 11:35pm
Rameen Rana
in full
Nov 07, 2018 11:35pm
Rameen Rana

Nov 07, 2018 11:35pm
Rameen Rana

Nov 07, 2018 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen

Nov 07, 2018 11:34pm
Rameen Rana

Nov 07, 2018 11:34pm
Kevin Stephen
wait what email
Nov 07, 2018 11:34pm

Nov 07, 2018 11:33pm
Rameen Rana
Look at that email
Nov 07, 2018 11:33pm
Kevin Stephen
what
Nov 07, 2018 11:33pm
Rameen Rana
Oh jesus
Nov 07, 2018 11:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Nov 07, 2018 10:54pm
Rameen Rana
*rare
Nov 07, 2018 10:52pm
Rameen Rana
its hard for a couple to be COMPLETELY aligned on their valuing of time like this
Nov 07, 2018 10:52pm
Rameen Rana
but like i see the probem here
Nov 07, 2018 10:52pm
Rameen Rana
well yes i agree
Nov 07, 2018 10:52pm
Kevin Stephen
also i think you are much more rational about your time than this
Nov 07, 2018 10:52pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah i mean i guess
Nov 07, 2018 10:52pm
Rameen Rana
which makes sense i guess
Nov 07, 2018 10:51pm
Rameen Rana
but she prioritizes people over other things so like rationally in her mind, this is worth it
Nov 07, 2018 10:51pm
Kevin Stephen
although she also rationally knows she doesn't have time for a long conversation either!
Nov 07, 2018 10:50pm
Kevin Stephen
this is how she feels, this is how i think
Nov 07, 2018 10:49pm
Kevin Stephen
which is clearly a difference of
Nov 07, 2018 10:49pm
Rameen Rana
lol i am such a sanika lmaooo
Nov 07, 2018 10:49pm
Rameen Rana
ooof
Nov 07, 2018 10:49pm
Rameen Rana
fucking cs bitches
Nov 07, 2018 10:49pm
Kevin Stephen
that's off putting
Nov 07, 2018 10:49pm
Rameen Rana
lol you and NEIL ARE A LOT MORE SIMILAR THAN OYU SEEM
Nov 07, 2018 10:49pm
Kevin Stephen
and she's like
Nov 07, 2018 10:49pm
Kevin Stephen
and i was like yes of course but i also will have to return to CS shortly bc i'm dying out here
Nov 07, 2018 10:49pm
Kevin Stephen
like she just texted me being like can we talk for real tonight
Nov 07, 2018 10:48pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah and that'll be an ongoing struggle even when it's not about things directly related to us
Nov 07, 2018 10:48pm
Rameen Rana
and shes an extremely emotional person
Nov 07, 2018 10:46pm
Rameen Rana
i think youre an extremely rational person
Nov 07, 2018 10:46pm
Rameen Rana
smh GET OVER UR ASS
Nov 07, 2018 10:46pm
Kevin Stephen
or just a me and sanika thing
Nov 07, 2018 10:45pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm like honestly not sure if this is empirically true
Nov 07, 2018 10:44pm
Rameen Rana
you tryna say guys are more rational than girls
Nov 07, 2018 10:44pm
Kevin Stephen
i sometimes wonder if the divide in thinking is gendered
Nov 07, 2018 10:44pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah
Nov 07, 2018 10:43pm
Rameen Rana
ya know?
Nov 07, 2018 10:42pm
Rameen Rana
because that isnt what she needs i feel liek
Nov 07, 2018 10:42pm
Rameen Rana
so yeah maybe don't' advice by saying here are rational answers to your problems
Nov 07, 2018 10:42pm
Kevin Stephen
also a secondary issue
Nov 07, 2018 10:41pm
Rameen Rana
10000%
Nov 07, 2018 10:41pm
Rameen Rana
but more of take care of you by maybe cutting back on this etc, honestly all she needs from you is advocacy and like hi im here
Nov 07, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
girl is far too considerate
Nov 07, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
i mean that is the actual problem
Nov 07, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah
Nov 07, 2018 10:40pm
Rameen Rana
so it is your job to remind her of that, I would veer awa y from saying things like "this is what i do" or like don't waste time on these things etc
Nov 07, 2018 10:40pm
Rameen Rana
yeah just always portraying things as hey i am here for you because i will always be thinking of YOU first, and that is the problem, sanika never thinks of herself first
Nov 07, 2018 10:39pm
Kevin Stephen
like good ways to phrase things
Nov 07, 2018 10:39pm
Rameen Rana
also
Nov 07, 2018 10:39pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah this is what i need
Nov 07, 2018 10:39pm
Kevin Stephen
ok that's a good way to put it
Nov 07, 2018 10:39pm
Rameen Rana
but asking if it would decresase her stress if she started saying no to things
Nov 07, 2018 10:39pm
Kevin Stephen
that's what i say
Nov 07, 2018 10:39pm
Rameen Rana
not teling her to take things off
Nov 07, 2018 10:38pm
Rameen Rana
so being like you need to be taking care of yourself
Nov 07, 2018 10:38pm
Kevin Stephen
of course
Nov 07, 2018 10:38pm
Rameen Rana
no i think its your job to consistently be HER advocate right
Nov 07, 2018 10:38pm
Kevin Stephen
or just like let her figure this out the hard way
Nov 07, 2018 10:37pm
Kevin Stephen
and i'm not sure if i should be like yo you are going to die if you keep doing this
Nov 07, 2018 10:37pm
Kevin Stephen
because of her impending deadlines
Nov 07, 2018 10:37pm
Kevin Stephen
and getting more and more stressed of course
Nov 07, 2018 10:37pm
Kevin Stephen
is putting more and more stuff on her plate and not saying no to things
Nov 07, 2018 10:37pm
Kevin Stephen
but looking at sanu's calendar she like
Nov 07, 2018 10:37pm
Rameen Rana
i wonder how she deals with stress
Nov 07, 2018 10:36pm
Rameen Rana
hm yes i see those as rational, but she may not agree with those hmm
Nov 07, 2018 10:36pm
Kevin Stephen
which i feel like are very rational responses to this
Nov 07, 2018 10:36pm
Kevin Stephen
3 honestly i pull back on social things that i don't need if they'll make me more stressed
Nov 07, 2018 10:36pm
Kevin Stephen
2 i cancel appointments or meetings i don't need to go to
Nov 07, 2018 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
1 i stop texting people back, turn my phone off and fucking grind until i feel better about my work position
Nov 07, 2018 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
so when this happens to me, i do a few things
Nov 07, 2018 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
like sruthi and julia for their campaign or tony and connor for breaktime etc
Nov 07, 2018 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
2 people just keep asking her to do things and she doesn't say no
Nov 07, 2018 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
1 she has like a lot of things due at the beginning of next week sunday and monday
Nov 07, 2018 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
because of a couple reasons
Nov 07, 2018 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
basically she's really stressed
Nov 07, 2018 10:34pm
Rameen Rana
hm okay hit me
Nov 07, 2018 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
i think i need to advise Sanu on this but not sure what the best way is to do this
Nov 07, 2018 10:34pm
Rameen Rana
Please!
Nov 07, 2018 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
can i think at you for 90 seconds
Nov 07, 2018 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
That‚Äôs freaking insane

Nov 07, 2018 4:14pm
Rameen Rana
HI GUYS!!! 

MY BEST FRIEND/ROLE MODEL/SISTER/TWIN/FAVORITE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE WORLD IS RUNNING FOR UC PRESIDENT!!!!!! I could not be prouder and more excited to support Sruthi and Julia as they run for US President and Vice President as they have worked so incredibly hard to make this campus home for so many.

Having had worked with them in both professional and personal contexts, I can confidently say that our school would be in great hands if they were leading it. Whether it be Sruthi‚Äôs role championing the education secondary or position as the Academic-Political Chair for the South Asian Association and Julia‚Äôs role in working with Title IX to enforce mandatory online sexual- and gender-based harassment training and position as a Diversity Peer Educator, Sruthi and Julia‚Äôs passion and hard work inside and outside of the UC will never cease to baffle me. They have spent the past 3 years making this school a better place, and I am so so SO excited to see where they can lead us into the future.

Voting begins November 12th! Visit their website at sruthiandjulia.org to learn more about their platform, which centers around diversity and inclusion, mental health, sexual violence prevention, empowering academics, and social spaces. If you have any questions, I could talk to you about Sruthi and Julia for hours, so please reach out!

Rameen Rana
An incisive endoscopy into the underbelly that is mobster Mumbai, Company, proved to be a riveting film.
Nov 04, 2018 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
back to paper writing
Nov 04, 2018 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
ok i'm done
Nov 04, 2018 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
there are just SO MANY DANGLING MODIFIERS
Nov 04, 2018 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
ok i overhyped this
Nov 04, 2018 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
An incisive endoscopy into the underbelly that is mobster Mumbai, Company, proved to be a riveting film. A world that is so often hidden in plain sight, Ram Gopal Varma reminds us just how much the mafia penetrates all facets of Indian society ‚Äì no stone left unturned. We saw the stretches of empire weave through premiere Indian institutions: police forces, politicians, Bollywood and across borders onto entire other continents. 

I was reminded of Khalnayak‚Äôs Ballu, heartened by criminals we hate to love, but in a unique twist, profits, moral bounds, and loyalty underscored every motivation and action.
Nov 04, 2018 11:38pm
Kevin Stephen
grammatically
Nov 04, 2018 11:38pm
Kevin Stephen
none of these sentences make any sense
Nov 04, 2018 11:38pm

Nov 04, 2018 11:38pm
Kevin Stephen
