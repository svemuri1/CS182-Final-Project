Taras Holovko

Sep 10, 2018 4:14pm
Taras Holovko
What is your gym split like
Jun 19, 2018 10:18am
Kevin Stephen
If it’s small then it could just be that there’s a lot of work to be done by relatively few people
Jun 19, 2018 7:44am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah that makes sense
Jun 19, 2018 7:43am
Taras Holovko
And I don't like that
Jun 18, 2018 8:33pm
Taras Holovko
It is very very traditional tho
Jun 18, 2018 8:33pm
Taras Holovko
So idk to what extent it being "large" informs facetime
Jun 18, 2018 8:33pm
Taras Holovko
That we have relatively few people for the size
Jun 18, 2018 8:32pm
Taras Holovko
I am saying
Jun 18, 2018 8:32pm
Taras Holovko
We were talking about the size of the funds
Jun 18, 2018 8:32pm
Taras Holovko
No
Jun 18, 2018 8:32pm
Kevin Stephen
Lmao are you trying to flex about the size of the fund where your sophomore internship is
Jun 18, 2018 8:31pm
Taras Holovko
So take as you will
Jun 18, 2018 8:24pm
Taras Holovko
And they still haven't exited everything ofc
Jun 18, 2018 8:24pm
Taras Holovko
I mean it's 4B aum total
Jun 18, 2018 8:24pm
Kevin Stephen
Ok yeah we have 6 or 7 people managing half of that so Argand is half the size
Jun 18, 2018 8:20pm
Taras Holovko
21 or so investment professionals for a 1B fund
Jun 18, 2018 8:11pm
Kevin Stephen
Oh how big is it?
Jun 18, 2018 8:11pm
Taras Holovko
The office is empty most of the time
Jun 18, 2018 8:11pm
Taras Holovko
I mean parthenon is not large
Jun 18, 2018 8:11pm
Taras Holovko
Right
Jun 18, 2018 8:11pm
Kevin Stephen
So I think I get to sidestep some of the bad parts about working at a bigger firm
Jun 18, 2018 7:38pm
Kevin Stephen
There’s just a lot of work to do sometimes haha
Jun 18, 2018 7:38pm
Kevin Stephen
They never make me work late unless I have to
Jun 18, 2018 7:37pm
Kevin Stephen
I think my company might be a little different
Jun 18, 2018 7:37pm
Taras Holovko
That is inherent in finance
Jun 18, 2018 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
Mostly the FaceTime culture
Jun 18, 2018 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
I dislike a lot of aspects of work
Jun 18, 2018 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
Lmao
Jun 18, 2018 7:07pm
Kevin Stephen
Even windows 10 is leagues behind macOS Sierra for pure productivity and functionality
Jun 18, 2018 7:04pm
Kevin Stephen
Is having to use windows
Jun 18, 2018 7:03pm
Kevin Stephen
The thing I hate most about work
Jun 18, 2018 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
Exactly
Jun 18, 2018 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
yep
Jun 18, 2018 6:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Good to realize now during your internship hahaha
Jun 18, 2018 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
And I don't like it
Jun 18, 2018 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
At the end of the day it's not for me
Jun 18, 2018 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
PE is all the same
Jun 18, 2018 6:59pm
Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen

Jun 18, 2018 6:57pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen

Jun 18, 2018 6:56pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen

Jun 14, 2018 3:53pm
Taras Holovko
Bain I LOVED everyone
Jun 12, 2018 5:41pm
Taras Holovko
sort of negative even tbh
Jun 12, 2018 5:41pm
Taras Holovko
I never had the best working relationship with
Jun 12, 2018 5:41pm
Taras Holovko
3-4 of them**
Jun 12, 2018 5:41pm
Taras Holovko
Maybe like 3-4 of Ben
Jun 12, 2018 5:41pm
Taras Holovko
I have probably 6-7 hccg friends
Jun 12, 2018 5:41pm
Taras Holovko
Gotcha
Jun 12, 2018 5:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Oh I only know a few mba students who were there before and I like them all
Jun 12, 2018 5:40pm
Taras Holovko
BCG has no PE presence either
Jun 12, 2018 5:40pm
Taras Holovko
I really liked my Bain friends though
Jun 12, 2018 5:40pm
Taras Holovko
I disliked several of the people there I knew
Jun 12, 2018 5:40pm
Taras Holovko
Mostly because
Jun 12, 2018 5:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes I think I’d probably fit better into the BCG culture than you would
Jun 12, 2018 5:40pm
Taras Holovko
I actually never liked BCG lol
Jun 12, 2018 5:37pm
Kevin Stephen
But idk
Jun 12, 2018 5:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Or maybe BCG a bit above Bain
Jun 12, 2018 5:23pm
Kevin Stephen
McKinsey first and then the other two on the same tier
Jun 12, 2018 5:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Uhh
Jun 12, 2018 5:22pm
Taras Holovko
What do you think of Bain vs BCG vs McK
Jun 12, 2018 5:20pm
Taras Holovko
Kevin
Jun 12, 2018 5:20pm
Taras Holovko
Meaning banking
Jun 12, 2018 8:08am
Taras Holovko
I have such a negative taste of the industry
Jun 12, 2018 8:08am
Taras Holovko
So glad I'm going into consulting
Jun 12, 2018 8:08am
Taras Holovko
Dude banking ducking sucks
Jun 12, 2018 8:08am
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha I’m definitely feeling it
Jun 12, 2018 8:04am
Taras Holovko
But maybe because I cycled through evercore first lol
Jun 12, 2018 8:04am
Taras Holovko
Feels much less consequential to me
Jun 12, 2018 8:04am
Taras Holovko
maybe
Jun 12, 2018 8:04am
Kevin Stephen
One of those major milestones in my life
Jun 12, 2018 8:03am
Kevin Stephen
It’s like a getting into Harvard feeling again
Jun 12, 2018 8:03am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah totally I’m feeling blessed
Jun 12, 2018 8:03am
Taras Holovko

Jun 12, 2018 8:03am
Taras Holovko
That's great
Jun 12, 2018 8:03am
Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko
Yeah see if you like it
Jun 12, 2018 8:02am
Taras Holovko
Got it
Jun 12, 2018 8:02am
Kevin Stephen
Brown boys haha
Jun 12, 2018 8:02am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah Kais is a current analyst there
Jun 12, 2018 8:02am
Kevin Stephen
Lol deep morning commute thoughts
Jun 12, 2018 8:02am
Kevin Stephen
So I think like I’m finally ready
Jun 12, 2018 8:02am
Kevin Stephen
I’ll have the time to invest in that person and be there for them
Jun 12, 2018 8:02am
Taras Holovko
IVP person?
Jun 12, 2018 8:02am
Taras Holovko
Who is Kais
Jun 12, 2018 8:02am
Taras Holovko
Harvard is a good place for it
Jun 12, 2018 8:01am
Kevin Stephen
2.5 years since I’ve dated anyone haha
Jun 12, 2018 8:01am
Taras Holovko
Lolol yes it has
Jun 12, 2018 8:01am
Kevin Stephen
It’s been a long time
Jun 12, 2018 8:01am
Taras Holovko
Yeah do it
Jun 12, 2018 8:00am
Kevin Stephen
Lmao no it’s time to get a girlfriend I think
Jun 12, 2018 8:00am
Kevin Stephen
Kais was telling me I shouldn’t be worried about the decision, most of the current analysts turned down their full time MBB offers for IVP so I should take the summer to see why they think it’s so cool
Jun 12, 2018 8:00am
Taras Holovko
Watching junior fall go down will be hilarious lol
Jun 12, 2018 7:59am
Kevin Stephen
I’m done hahaha
Jun 12, 2018 7:59am
Taras Holovko
That's awesome, congrats man

Jun 12, 2018 7:59am
Taras Holovko
yeah hahahah
Jun 12, 2018 7:58am
Taras Holovko
All the way from August to spring break
Jun 12, 2018 7:58am
Kevin Stephen
Took me like three weeks to get IVP and then two days to get a “final round” Bain interview
Jun 12, 2018 7:58am
Taras Holovko
I searched for sophomore summer
Jun 12, 2018 7:58am
Taras Holovko
Yeah lmao
Jun 12, 2018 7:58am
Kevin Stephen
Took me from September to almost February to land this summers internship and my term time
Jun 12, 2018 7:58am
Kevin Stephen
Oh yeah facts
Jun 12, 2018 7:57am
Taras Holovko
Junior year was done so quickly haha
Jun 12, 2018 7:56am
Taras Holovko
Is that it took MONTHS to get a sophomore internship
Jun 12, 2018 7:56am
Taras Holovko
Also another thought I had with Ashhab
Jun 12, 2018 7:56am
Taras Holovko
I.e. Takes YEARS to do anything
Jun 12, 2018 7:56am
Taras Holovko
Since I need more patience there haha
Jun 12, 2018 7:56am
Taras Holovko
I like weight lifting more
Jun 12, 2018 7:55am
Kevin Stephen
And those things have paid off more than anything else
Jun 12, 2018 7:55am
Taras Holovko
Truth
Jun 12, 2018 7:55am
Kevin Stephen
And patience
Jun 12, 2018 7:55am
Kevin Stephen
I learned grit
Jun 12, 2018 7:55am
Kevin Stephen
I actually think running cross country was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in life
Jun 12, 2018 7:55am
Taras Holovko
I could literally be done career wise forever yk
Jun 12, 2018 7:51am
Taras Holovko
In that time I got a winternship, spring internship, and 2 summer internships
Jun 12, 2018 7:51am
Taras Holovko
I started thinking about internships 10 months ago
Jun 12, 2018 7:50am
Taras Holovko
Idk dude freshman year I just did classes
Jun 12, 2018 7:50am
Kevin Stephen
No one realizes how hard they should be working in high school
Jun 12, 2018 7:50am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah and being at Harvard opens a ton of doors in professional life and makes other things much less of an uphill battle
Jun 12, 2018 7:50am
Taras Holovko
Was the hardest thing I've ever done
Jun 12, 2018 7:49am
Taras Holovko
Getting into Harvard
Jun 12, 2018 7:49am
Taras Holovko
lmao dude that's true but like
Jun 12, 2018 7:49am
Kevin Stephen
But I’ve definitely worked really hard the past two years to become a good job candidate
Jun 12, 2018 7:49am
Kevin Stephen
Haha that’s a comparison I haven’t thought about yet
Jun 12, 2018 7:49am
Taras Holovko
Honestly dude careee stuff was much easier than getting into Harvard haha
Jun 12, 2018 7:48am
Taras Holovko
That's dope
Jun 12, 2018 7:48am
Kevin Stephen
Young and hip place to work
Jun 12, 2018 7:39am
Kevin Stephen
Right next to Bryant Park
Jun 12, 2018 7:39am
Kevin Stephen
Awesome location in the city
Jun 12, 2018 7:39am
Taras Holovko
It's a small world
Jun 12, 2018 7:39am
Taras Holovko
McKinsey was in same building as MS and EVR
Jun 12, 2018 7:39am
Taras Holovko
Oh that's pretty sick actually
Jun 12, 2018 7:39am
Kevin Stephen
IVP and Bain offices are just a few floors apart
Jun 12, 2018 7:33am
Kevin Stephen
We’ll be working in the same building next year
Jun 12, 2018 7:33am
Kevin Stephen
LOL
Jun 12, 2018 7:33am
Kevin Stephen
Just because I ended up emailing the recruiter with my resume after fall activities fair and she remembered and reached out to me
Jun 12, 2018 7:32am
Kevin Stephen
I also like got my initial interview at Insight by accident
Jun 12, 2018 7:32am

Taras sent a photo.

Jun 12, 2018 7:31am
Taras Holovko

Jun 12, 2018 7:31am
Kevin Stephen
Coming into 2018 I was like really concerned about my professional path and life after school
Jun 12, 2018 7:31am
Taras Holovko
I've had this forever
Jun 12, 2018 7:31am
Taras Holovko
By the way
Jun 12, 2018 7:31am
Kevin Stephen
I can’t be more grateful for the position I’m in
Jun 12, 2018 7:31am
Kevin Stephen
Tbh it’s been an awesome six months for me
Jun 12, 2018 7:30am
Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko
Good
Jun 12, 2018 7:29am

Jun 12, 2018 7:29am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah for sure
Jun 12, 2018 7:29am
Taras Holovko
Way beyond stuff I had ever thought about
Jun 12, 2018 7:28am
Taras Holovko
About how to prep
Jun 12, 2018 7:28am
Taras Holovko
I learned a LOT
Jun 12, 2018 7:28am
Taras Holovko

Jun 12, 2018 7:28am
Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko
Some parts I fucked up
Jun 12, 2018 7:26am
Taras Holovko
Some tricky parts
Jun 12, 2018 7:26am
Taras Holovko
Fine, they were the usual
Jun 12, 2018 7:26am
Kevin Stephen
How were the cases?
Jun 12, 2018 7:26am
Taras Holovko
I would've taken bain over BCG
Jun 12, 2018 7:26am
Taras Holovko
So I'm really happy
Jun 12, 2018 7:26am
Taras Holovko
They've been on glassdoor's top 4 companies as self rated by employees for 9 years

Jun 12, 2018 7:25am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah Bain said they’ll give me a mentor in the nyc office and if I don’t like IVP next summer then they’ll interview me next summer for full time
Jun 12, 2018 7:25am

Kevin Stephen

Jun 08, 2018 2:41pm
Taras Holovko
They did the winternship
Jun 08, 2018 2:38pm
Taras Holovko
It'd be Karen and Luke Minton
Jun 08, 2018 2:38pm
Taras Holovko
If people were to get it
Jun 08, 2018 2:38pm
Taras Holovko
Bain cap is different
Jun 08, 2018 2:38pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah
Jun 08, 2018 2:38pm
Kevin Stephen
I also would need time to get ready for a PE case study situation hahahahaha
Jun 08, 2018 2:38pm
Kevin Stephen
I emailed Bain Cap but my contact hasn’t gotten back to me about early interviews
Jun 08, 2018 2:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Jun 08, 2018 2:37pm
Taras Holovko
Very connection based in finance
Jun 08, 2018 2:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Who it was
Jun 08, 2018 2:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Just heard from someone I forget
Jun 08, 2018 2:37pm
Kevin Stephen

Jun 08, 2018 2:37pm
Taras Holovko

Jun 08, 2018 2:36pm
Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen
Bain Cap has I know
Jun 08, 2018 2:36pm
Taras Holovko
Bain has given out offers?
Jun 08, 2018 2:36pm
Kevin Stephen
Idk about consulting but banking and buy side yeah
Jun 08, 2018 2:36pm
Kevin Stephen
Like all these places have been giving out a lot of offers
Jun 08, 2018 2:36pm
Taras Holovko
hm yeah
Jun 08, 2018 2:36pm
Kevin Stephen
No if anything it’s more lenient right now
Jun 08, 2018 2:35pm
Taras Holovko
I hope they don't have an early quota haha
Jun 08, 2018 2:35pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah I feel
Jun 08, 2018 2:33pm
Kevin Stephen
I’d largely prefer New York office too it’s literally across the street from me
Jun 08, 2018 2:32pm
Kevin Stephen
Nicki says she’s waiting for confirmation from the New York office
Jun 08, 2018 2:32pm
Taras Holovko
Lmk what ends up happening with office?
Jun 08, 2018 2:31pm
Taras Holovko
If you don't whatever you were gonna take Insight right?
Jun 08, 2018 11:10am
Taras Holovko
if you get it good
Jun 08, 2018 11:10am
Taras Holovko
And hey no downside
Jun 08, 2018 11:10am
Taras Holovko

Jun 08, 2018 11:10am
Taras Holovko
Prep hard this weekend
Jun 08, 2018 11:10am
Kevin Stephen
Not ready for this
Jun 08, 2018 11:10am
Taras Holovko

Jun 08, 2018 11:09am
Kevin Stephen
I’ve never cased
Jun 08, 2018 11:09am
Taras Holovko
Fucking hilarious
Jun 08, 2018 11:09am
Taras Holovko
If we end up atbain together
Jun 08, 2018 11:09am
Taras Holovko
Lmao dude
Jun 08, 2018 11:09am
Kevin Stephen
Probably wouldn’t matter
Jun 08, 2018 11:08am
Taras Holovko
I think it'd probably be best if we're interviewing in separate offices
Jun 08, 2018 11:08am
Kevin Stephen
So she said ok I’ll see what I can do
Jun 08, 2018 11:08am
Kevin Stephen
But on the phone w Nicki I just said I work two blocks away from Bain New York
Jun 08, 2018 11:08am
Taras Holovko
Lmao fuck it's you and me
Jun 08, 2018 11:08am
Taras Holovko
they want you in Boston on Monday?
Jun 08, 2018 11:08am
Kevin Stephen
They just said Boston
Jun 08, 2018 11:07am
Taras Holovko
NYC?
Jun 08, 2018 11:06am
Kevin Stephen
Oh fuck Bain wants to interview me Monday
Jun 08, 2018 11:04am
Taras Holovko
One time switch is ok, multiple are not
Jun 08, 2018 7:31am
Taras Holovko
Very hard to switch back and forth
Jun 08, 2018 7:31am
Taras Holovko
Lmao doing a Morgan stanley hirevue right now fml
Jun 08, 2018 7:30am
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko
Summit

Kevin Stephen

Jun 07, 2018 10:35am
Kevin Stephen
ok i gtg
Jun 07, 2018 10:35am
Kevin Stephen
oof yeah lot to think about
Jun 07, 2018 10:35am
Taras Holovko
If even
Jun 07, 2018 10:34am
Taras Holovko
there's like 2-3 shops that are better maybe
Jun 07, 2018 10:34am
Taras Holovko
Was not aware
Jun 07, 2018 10:34am
Taras Holovko
By clasiscation
Jun 07, 2018 10:34am
Taras Holovko
Oh shit insight is consider growth
Jun 07, 2018 10:34am
Taras Holovko
And you still wouldn't have a fund that size
Jun 07, 2018 10:33am
Taras Holovko
All of my 2018 summer offers combined
Jun 07, 2018 10:33am
Kevin Stephen
the insight fund right
Jun 07, 2018 10:33am
Taras Holovko
That's like
Jun 07, 2018 10:33am
Taras Holovko
That's so big
Jun 07, 2018 10:33am
Taras Holovko
That's fucking massive
Jun 07, 2018 10:33am
Taras Holovko
IX was 4.75B
Jun 07, 2018 10:33am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah lot to think about
Jun 07, 2018 10:32am
Taras Holovko
Lmao shit dude
Jun 07, 2018 10:32am
Taras Holovko
Because fund is probably massive
Jun 07, 2018 10:32am
Taras Holovko
Insight is that 10x
Jun 07, 2018 10:32am
Taras Holovko
Like imagine getting half a million dollars years after you find some great company
Jun 07, 2018 10:32am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah crazy
Jun 07, 2018 10:32am
Taras Holovko
They exited it and he got a fat check in the mail
Jun 07, 2018 10:32am
Taras Holovko
Long after he'd forgotten about it
Jun 07, 2018 10:32am
Taras Holovko
Like 5 years later
Jun 07, 2018 10:31am
Taras Holovko
Left volition, went to b school, then became Vp
Jun 07, 2018 10:31am
Taras Holovko
One of their top investments in this fund
Jun 07, 2018 10:31am
Taras Holovko
Sourced Chewy
Jun 07, 2018 10:31am
Taras Holovko
E.g. A guy at Volition
Jun 07, 2018 10:31am
Taras Holovko
If you find a great company and they invest
Jun 07, 2018 10:31am
Taras Holovko
But hey man it rewards performance
Jun 07, 2018 10:31am
Kevin Stephen
private equity like blackstone yes
Jun 07, 2018 10:31am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah that's fair although you really don't need banking skills to get into growth equity
Jun 07, 2018 10:31am
Taras Holovko
than right out of college
Jun 07, 2018 10:30am
Kevin Stephen
my friend Kais rn is in London speaking with startups there this week
Jun 07, 2018 10:30am
Taras Holovko
Because I thought I'd be better prepared for anything buyside after 2 years of IB
Jun 07, 2018 10:30am
Kevin Stephen
yeah
Jun 07, 2018 10:30am
Taras Holovko
I also decided I don't want buyside
Jun 07, 2018 10:30am
Taras Holovko
but do really cool stuff
Jun 07, 2018 10:30am
Taras Holovko
Because you still make a ton of money
Jun 07, 2018 10:30am
Taras Holovko
IVP balances that maybe
Jun 07, 2018 10:30am
Taras Holovko
The easy / given path
Jun 07, 2018 10:30am
Taras Holovko
And what you said about doing stuff that's cool and not like
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Kevin Stephen
oh that's interesting
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Taras Holovko
Evercore isn't as global as MS or whatever
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Taras Holovko
Not finance
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Taras Holovko
And be in industry
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Kevin Stephen
for sure
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Taras Holovko
I want to go to china
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Kevin Stephen
or Bain
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Taras Holovko
Long term
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Kevin Stephen
yeah i mean i'd take a pay cut to work at McKinsey
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Taras Holovko
Evercore doesn't make sense
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Taras Holovko
For me
Jun 07, 2018 10:29am
Taras Holovko
So most of the money would be going into my pocket, and some to my family in Ukraine even though they'd never take it lol
Jun 07, 2018 10:28am
Taras Holovko
but I am of course lucky to have financial aid / no debt
Jun 07, 2018 10:28am
Taras Holovko
I thought about it and decided while it was nice, it was not sufficiently important to change my whole career trajectory
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Kevin Stephen
have a big family that i should give back to after college
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Kevin Stephen
that probably should be important to me
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Taras Holovko
Pays about the same as insight
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Taras Holovko
I thought the same about EVR
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Taras Holovko
yeah man if that's important to you
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Kevin Stephen
which is not trivial
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Taras Holovko
Totally different risk approach
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Kevin Stephen
it's also like a 60K pay raise over consulting
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Taras Holovko
And then hits a Facebook or LinkedIn every once in a while lol
Jun 07, 2018 10:27am
Kevin Stephen
right
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Taras Holovko
Sequoia loses money on like 95% of stuff
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Taras Holovko
like sequoia
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Taras Holovko
no gambling on random shit
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Taras Holovko
Organic growth oriented
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Kevin Stephen
it's done seed and private equity
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Taras Holovko
no financial engineering
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Taras Holovko
It keeps the excitement in and the bullshit out
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Kevin Stephen
insight does deals at all stages too which is cool
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Taras Holovko
And better than PE or VC
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Taras Holovko
I think GE is the best medium actually
Jun 07, 2018 10:26am
Taras Holovko
And I'd never go into super early VC
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Taras Holovko
I think early is a lot of bullshit
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Kevin Stephen
and they almost never take undergrads
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Taras Holovko
Great space
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Taras Holovko
GE SaaS is what I did at Volition
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Taras Holovko
And I think growth equity SaaS > VC
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Kevin Stephen
a lot of those guys are more early stage
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Taras Holovko
But for VCs that recruit out of college / growth equity yeah
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Kevin Stephen
being growth equity SaaS investors
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Taras Holovko
There's a ton more like sequoia And accel, NEA, etc
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Kevin Stephen
I think it's top of its class
Jun 07, 2018 10:25am
Taras Holovko
I don't think IVP is top for VCs per se
Jun 07, 2018 10:24am
Taras Holovko
I didn't even know that
Jun 07, 2018 10:24am
Taras Holovko
Yeah exactly man I think that's sick
Jun 07, 2018 10:24am
Kevin Stephen
in tech
Jun 07, 2018 10:24am
Taras Holovko
Others being bvp (worse) and idk
Jun 07, 2018 10:24am
Kevin Stephen
it's also the VC with the most exits
Jun 07, 2018 10:24am
Taras Holovko
And it's pretty much one of two or three VCs that takes kids out of college
Jun 07, 2018 10:24am
Taras Holovko
So that's a pro
Jun 07, 2018 10:23am
Taras Holovko
I can see how insight meshes with your interest in tech
Jun 07, 2018 10:23am
Taras Holovko
And have the next year to prep for that
Jun 07, 2018 10:23am
Taras Holovko
And then recruit senior fall for consulting
Jun 07, 2018 10:23am
Taras Holovko
Which is about all I care for IB
Jun 07, 2018 10:23am
Taras Holovko
I would learn for 10 weeks
Jun 07, 2018 10:23am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I think if MBB doesn't interview me in the next week or so, I'll take Insight
Jun 07, 2018 10:23am
Taras Holovko
Or should I get Bain
Jun 07, 2018 10:22am
Taras Holovko
Should MBB not have interviewed me
Jun 07, 2018 10:22am
Taras Holovko
I was planning on taking evercore
Jun 07, 2018 10:22am
Taras Holovko
In terms of risk profile
Jun 07, 2018 10:22am
Taras Holovko
Anyway though
Jun 07, 2018 10:22am
Taras Holovko
Of course all this is resolved if I get Bain
Jun 07, 2018 10:22am
Taras Holovko
Where California tech is guaranteed
Jun 07, 2018 10:21am
Taras Holovko
And if I'm placed in utilities or something for MS I'd kms
Jun 07, 2018 10:21am
Taras Holovko
also uncertain group placement
Jun 07, 2018 10:21am
Taras Holovko
I can't be out 3 days in a week
Jun 07, 2018 10:21am
Taras Holovko
Unsure also how / if I should do Morgan stanley New York
Jun 07, 2018 10:21am
Taras Holovko
Have to prep hard
Jun 07, 2018 10:20am
Taras Holovko
Thanks for the encouragement
Jun 07, 2018 10:20am
Taras Holovko
Idk man it's a crapshoot
Jun 07, 2018 10:20am
Kevin Stephen
there isn't much better consulting talent coming out of college
Jun 07, 2018 10:20am
Taras Holovko
My intuition is that I would take ms tech over evercore but I am not confident
Jun 07, 2018 10:20am
Kevin Stephen
can't think about why Bain wouldn't take you
Jun 07, 2018 10:20am
Taras Holovko
And I'm still thinking about flying out to California for Morgan stanley tech
Jun 07, 2018 10:20am
Taras Holovko
I'm taking evercore
Jun 07, 2018 10:20am
Taras Holovko
If I do not get Bain
Jun 07, 2018 10:19am
Kevin Stephen
have you already had an initial interview w Bain?
Jun 07, 2018 10:19am
Taras Holovko
That being said
Jun 07, 2018 10:19am
Taras Holovko
Given that they accommodated me so graciously
Jun 07, 2018 10:19am
Taras Holovko
And probably would not go to BCG
Jun 07, 2018 10:19am
Taras Holovko
I would feel very very indebted to the company
Jun 07, 2018 10:19am
Taras Holovko
also if I get Bain
Jun 07, 2018 10:19am
Taras Holovko
Assuming that McKinsey would even budge in the 2 week timeframe that Bain gives me should I receive an offer, knock on wood
Jun 07, 2018 10:19am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I feel like at this rate my chances of getting an interview in time for MBB are increasingly low
Jun 07, 2018 10:19am
Taras Holovko
And I only have one interview left for the rest of my time in college
Jun 07, 2018 10:18am
Kevin Stephen
you have enough experience casing
Jun 07, 2018 10:18am
Taras Holovko
If I do get Bain my problem is resolved
Jun 07, 2018 10:18am
Kevin Stephen
You'll probs get Bain
Jun 07, 2018 10:18am
Taras Holovko
Unlikely / less likely
Jun 07, 2018 10:18am
Taras Holovko
And if I don't get Bain then it's unlikely that I'll get BCG and I should take evercore anyway
Jun 07, 2018 10:18am
Taras Holovko
Fortunately I am blessed with the opportunity to interview with Bain next week
Jun 07, 2018 10:17am
Kevin Stephen
same exact line of thinking
Jun 07, 2018 10:17am
Taras Holovko
and that I would've regretted not taking EVR
Jun 07, 2018 10:17am
Kevin Stephen
Right
Jun 07, 2018 10:17am
Taras Holovko
I'm shit out of luck
Jun 07, 2018 10:17am
Taras Holovko
If I don't get Bain and BCG
Jun 07, 2018 10:17am
Kevin Stephen
McKinsey kind of a crapshoot yeah
Jun 07, 2018 10:17am
Taras Holovko
I also thought
Jun 07, 2018 10:17am
Taras Holovko
But Bain and BCG were decent
Jun 07, 2018 10:17am
Taras Holovko
and came to the conclusion that McKinsey was very low
Jun 07, 2018 10:16am
Taras Holovko
Then I thought about the probability of getting an MBB offer in the fall
Jun 07, 2018 10:16am
Taras Holovko
Evercore is probably the best then, in terms of finance-internal, for me
Jun 07, 2018 10:16am
Kevin Stephen
Right so then your question becomes a question of banking vs consulting
Jun 07, 2018 10:16am
Taras Holovko
MS tech superday and MS NYC still in, but those are not clear winners because 1) tech is in California and 2) NYC has unclear group placement
Jun 07, 2018 10:16am
Taras Holovko
GS was out
Jun 07, 2018 10:15am
Taras Holovko
I came to the conclusion I had pretty much optimized IB
Jun 07, 2018 10:15am
Taras Holovko
Based on that
Jun 07, 2018 10:15am
Taras Holovko
Better than some - not all - groups at Morgan stanley, namely M&A and tech I would take over EVR
Jun 07, 2018 10:15am
Taras Holovko
And not quite sure about Morgan stanley
Jun 07, 2018 10:15am
Taras Holovko
GS
Jun 07, 2018 10:14am
Taras Holovko
After MBB
Jun 07, 2018 10:14am
Taras Holovko
Maybe my 5th or 6th choice
Jun 07, 2018 10:13am
Taras Holovko
So I think I hold EVR in same regard as you insight
Jun 07, 2018 10:13am
Kevin Stephen
at the end of the day the only reason i think consulting is cooler than VC out of college is because that's what i've been told
Jun 07, 2018 10:11am
Kevin Stephen
we're more likely to only consider things as valuable when others assure us that they are
Jun 07, 2018 10:10am
Kevin Stephen
tough to see the value of things when they're finally given to you
Jun 07, 2018 10:10am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah idk
Jun 07, 2018 10:10am
Taras Holovko
Better to grit teeth and stick with it
Jun 07, 2018 10:04am
Taras Holovko
But I think that's a silly one
Jun 07, 2018 10:04am
Taras Holovko
How much do you want to be done with this
Jun 07, 2018 10:04am
Taras Holovko
Another consideration is just like
Jun 07, 2018 10:04am
Taras Holovko
can't go wrong
Jun 07, 2018 10:00am
Taras Holovko
Yeah good call
Jun 07, 2018 10:00am
Kevin Stephen
Will pray about it
Jun 07, 2018 10:00am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Jun 07, 2018 10:00am
Taras Holovko
No matter how long you spend weighing pros and cons
Jun 07, 2018 10:00am
Taras Holovko
There's no other way to decide
Jun 07, 2018 10:00am
Taras Holovko
Go with your gut
Jun 07, 2018 10:00am
Taras Holovko
Exactly
Jun 07, 2018 9:59am
Kevin Stephen
World at your hands
Jun 07, 2018 9:59am
Taras Holovko
I think it's a privilege to have the option to make $175 out of college
Jun 07, 2018 9:59am
Kevin Stephen
Yes you should
Jun 07, 2018 9:59am
Taras Holovko
To be in this position
Jun 07, 2018 9:59am
Taras Holovko
I mean I feel very lucky
Jun 07, 2018 9:58am
Taras Holovko
great options
Jun 07, 2018 9:58am
Taras Holovko
Damn
Jun 07, 2018 9:58am
Kevin Stephen
I’m not stressing either way
Jun 07, 2018 9:58am
Kevin Stephen
Ok I’m just waiting to hear back then
Jun 07, 2018 9:58am
Taras Holovko
Yesterday was her last day according to what she told me
Jun 07, 2018 9:58am
Taras Holovko
She was the one I emailed
Jun 07, 2018 9:58am
Taras Holovko
My former contact left bain yesterday
Jun 07, 2018 9:58am
Taras Holovko
The person you reached out to is the correct contact
Jun 07, 2018 9:57am
Kevin Stephen
Whom did you reach out to?
Jun 07, 2018 9:57am
Kevin Stephen
From Bain no
Jun 07, 2018 9:57am
Taras Holovko
Any word from them?
Jun 07, 2018 9:57am
Taras Holovko
Thanks I'm just doing case prep right now
Jun 07, 2018 9:57am
Kevin Stephen
Good luck dude
Jun 07, 2018 9:57am
Taras Holovko
Potentially have 2 Morgan stanley superdays but no fucking clue how I'm going to manage that
Jun 07, 2018 9:56am
Taras Holovko
I'd take bain over anything except McKinsey
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Taras Holovko
But crossing my fingers that I wrap it all up next week
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah that’s v tough
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Taras Holovko
And now work
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Taras Holovko
Since I studied hard for IB
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Taras Holovko
I didn't get a summer break
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Taras Holovko
Then junior started
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Taras Holovko
Sophomore stuff ended spring break
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Taras Holovko
I've been recruiting for 10 months
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Kevin Stephen
Damn it’s too early to feel burnt out
Jun 07, 2018 9:55am
Taras Holovko
But that's mostly because I also have to handle case prep on top of things and feel really burnt out
Jun 07, 2018 9:54am
Taras Holovko
I hate it
Jun 07, 2018 9:54am
Taras Holovko
but 8-8 sucks
Jun 07, 2018 9:54am
Taras Holovko
I didn't really get what people meant until i started working this summer
Jun 07, 2018 9:54am
Taras Holovko
Idk man
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Kevin Stephen
No I mean hours
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Taras Holovko
oh time in the office you mean?
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Taras Holovko
I mean that's my offer deadline
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Kevin Stephen
Is that one of your main considerations?
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Kevin Stephen
Oh damn that’s brutal
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Taras Holovko
Fucking brutal
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Taras Holovko
#3 for banks
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Taras Holovko
Idk evercore was 82.5 hours on avg 2017
Jun 07, 2018 9:53am
Taras Holovko
About the same as worst days in consulting probably
Jun 07, 2018 9:52am
Kevin Stephen
Hm yeah hours for insight aren’t as bad as IB but they’re longer than consulting
Jun 07, 2018 9:52am
Taras Holovko
IB doesn't respect your life or time
Jun 07, 2018 9:51am
Taras Holovko
I wouldn't be cool with absurd hours
Jun 07, 2018 9:51am
Kevin Stephen
Which I think I’d like a lot
Jun 07, 2018 9:51am
Taras Holovko
I'd be cool with modeling
Jun 07, 2018 9:51am
Kevin Stephen
Or casing for consulting
Jun 07, 2018 9:51am
Kevin Stephen
No I definitely would
Jun 07, 2018 9:51am
Taras Holovko
Haha maybe yeah
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Kevin Stephen
Which I think I’d hate more
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Kevin Stephen
Alternative is modeling for banking
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Taras Holovko
But idk
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Taras Holovko
I think it's different for VC
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Taras Holovko
Yeah for sure
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Kevin Stephen
Favorite part of the job
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Kevin Stephen
I love sourcing for CBE
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Taras Holovko
Contrary and volition a bit
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Kevin Stephen
For volition?
Jun 07, 2018 9:50am
Taras Holovko
Absolutely despises it
Jun 07, 2018 9:49am
Taras Holovko
I hated sourcing
Jun 07, 2018 9:49am
Taras Holovko
Your call man
Jun 07, 2018 9:49am
Kevin Stephen
And 3) learn how companies work
Jun 07, 2018 9:49am
Kevin Stephen
2) build a network
Jun 07, 2018 9:49am
Kevin Stephen
No sourcing is a good way to 1) learn everything about all the verticals you’re interested in
Jun 07, 2018 9:49am
Kevin Stephen
Lmao
Jun 07, 2018 9:49am
Taras Holovko
Or going into VC to break into VC
Jun 07, 2018 9:48am
Kevin Stephen
Sourcing is great
Jun 07, 2018 9:48am
Taras Holovko
Lolol going into consulting to break into VC
Jun 07, 2018 9:48am
Kevin Stephen
Or doing VC and then switching to something else
Jun 07, 2018 9:48am
Taras Holovko
Entry level is sourcing heavy
Jun 07, 2018 9:48am
Kevin Stephen
Going consulting to break into VC
Jun 07, 2018 9:48am
Kevin Stephen
Well the real question there is what’s easier
Jun 07, 2018 9:48am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Jun 07, 2018 9:48am
Taras Holovko
Or transfer in after a few years of consulting banking
Jun 07, 2018 9:30am
Taras Holovko
Like analyst level
Jun 07, 2018 9:30am
Taras Holovko
Would you prefer to enter really early
Jun 07, 2018 9:30am
Taras Holovko
The only consideration
Jun 07, 2018 9:30am
Taras Holovko
Agree about that
Jun 07, 2018 9:30am
Taras Holovko
yeah
Jun 07, 2018 9:30am
Kevin Stephen
People are cool and excited about young founders and entrepreneurs
Jun 07, 2018 9:30am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Jun 07, 2018 9:29am
Taras Holovko
VC also != the vibes from the rest of finance
Jun 07, 2018 9:29am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah that’s not the goal definitely
Jun 07, 2018 9:29am
Taras Holovko
It's a really easy way to get really rich
Jun 07, 2018 9:27am
Taras Holovko
Well it doesn't suck
Jun 07, 2018 9:27am
Taras Holovko
Lol
Jun 07, 2018 9:27am
Taras Holovko
PE sucks dude
Jun 07, 2018 9:27am
Taras Holovko
100% agree on that
Jun 07, 2018 9:26am
Kevin Stephen
Early stage tech is where new things happen
Jun 07, 2018 9:26am
Kevin Stephen
Much more interesting to me than like private equity or stock trading
Jun 07, 2018 9:26am
Kevin Stephen
I’m super interested
Jun 07, 2018 9:25am
Taras Holovko
I don't know
You have to think about how interested you are in the space
Jun 07, 2018 9:25am
Taras Holovko
Hm
Jun 07, 2018 9:22am
Taras Holovko
hey
Jun 07, 2018 9:22am
Kevin Stephen
Should I take?
Jun 07, 2018 9:22am
Kevin Stephen
What do you think
Jun 07, 2018 9:22am
Taras Holovko
Talk to Hanl Baveja
Jun 05, 2018 7:29pm
Taras Holovko
right
Jun 05, 2018 7:24pm
Kevin Stephen
Which I can’t viably recruit for until senior year
Jun 05, 2018 7:24pm
Kevin Stephen
There really aren’t except big four tech
Jun 05, 2018 7:24pm
Taras Holovko
I would subtract 1/3 for taxes and 20 for living but yeah
Jun 05, 2018 7:24pm
Taras Holovko
the salary is a lot I agree
Jun 05, 2018 7:23pm
Taras Holovko
Up to you
Jun 05, 2018 7:23pm
Taras Holovko
Idk if there are many better places
Jun 05, 2018 7:23pm
Taras Holovko
and I mean if you want to go into tech
Jun 05, 2018 7:23pm
Taras Holovko
So idk
Jun 05, 2018 7:23pm
Taras Holovko
because VC is so small
Jun 05, 2018 7:23pm
Kevin Stephen
That’s also true
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
You'll have time
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
so if you HATE it
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
You're best positioned for MBB recruiting senior fall with a unique gig like insight
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Kevin Stephen
I can pay Ryan’s College tuition literally
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
Tbh dude
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
Summer was like 23
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Maybe I’ll just take it
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
Base is 95
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Crazy money
Jun 05, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
And they've been doing well too lol it'll go up in 2 years
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Kevin Stephen
My salary is only like 85
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Taras Holovko
Nah bonus
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Kevin Stephen
That’s the salary?
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Kevin Stephen
That’s insane
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Taras Holovko
EVR is 175
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Taras Holovko
If you want the money it's there
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Kevin Stephen
That’s crazy
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Taras Holovko
Buy side pays a lot man
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah that's a ton
Jun 05, 2018 7:21pm
Kevin Stephen
😦
Jun 05, 2018 7:20pm
Kevin Stephen
You sent a photo.

Jun 05, 2018 7:20pm
Taras Holovko
Lmk
Jun 05, 2018 6:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Ok I’ll shoot her an email
Jun 05, 2018 6:36pm
Taras Holovko
chain
Jun 05, 2018 6:35pm
Taras Holovko
She was on email Cain
Jun 05, 2018 6:35pm
Taras Holovko
I think she would be good yeah
Jun 05, 2018 6:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Did you reach out to Nicki Barnett for Bain? She’s the person I know there in recruiting
Jun 05, 2018 6:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah and I probably shouldn’t bet on getting MBB hahaha
Jun 05, 2018 6:34pm
Taras Holovko
Pro is that you'd be done entirely haha
Jun 05, 2018 6:34pm
Taras Holovko
That's hard
Jun 05, 2018 6:25pm
Taras Holovko
yeah fuck
Jun 05, 2018 6:25pm
Kevin Stephen
Idk
Jun 05, 2018 6:25pm
Kevin Stephen
Sooo
Jun 05, 2018 6:25pm
Kevin Stephen
But I think I’d take MBB over VC
Jun 05, 2018 6:25pm
Taras Holovko
Gotcha
Jun 05, 2018 6:25pm
Taras Holovko
Wow yeah that's awesome
Jun 05, 2018 6:24pm
Kevin Stephen
I’d take this over any banking offer except maybe Goldman
Jun 05, 2018 6:24pm
Taras Holovko
That's crazy
Jun 05, 2018 6:24pm
Taras Holovko
Holy shit
Jun 05, 2018 6:24pm
Kevin Stephen
Well I only have till June 10
Jun 05, 2018 6:24pm
Taras Holovko
What're u thinking
Jun 05, 2018 6:24pm
Kevin Stephen
It’s definitely a lot of sourcing haha I’ll have to think about it
Jun 05, 2018 6:22pm
Kevin Stephen
I’m super hyped
Jun 05, 2018 6:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Thanks dude
Jun 05, 2018 6:22pm
Taras Holovko
Can't go higher out of college
Jun 05, 2018 5:35pm
Taras Holovko
They're like the top for VC
Jun 05, 2018 5:35pm
Taras Holovko
That's sick
Jun 05, 2018 5:35pm
Taras Holovko
Dudeeee congrats :D
Jun 05, 2018 5:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Insight!
Jun 05, 2018 5:35pm
Taras Holovko
This is super exciting
Jun 05, 2018 5:34pm
Taras Holovko
Congrats
Jun 05, 2018 5:33pm
Taras Holovko
From who
Jun 05, 2018 5:33pm
Kevin Stephen
I got an offer!!
Jun 05, 2018 5:15pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahahaha thank you that means a lot to me
Jun 04, 2018 8:33pm
Taras Holovko
Ashhab and I were raving over your CBE description on LinkedIn lol
Jun 04, 2018 7:42pm
Taras Holovko
Hey dude
Jun 04, 2018 7:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I was probably too late to that one
Jun 04, 2018 6:57pm
Taras Holovko
Like May 3??
Jun 04, 2018 6:57pm
Taras Holovko
Sorry I mean early May***
Jun 04, 2018 6:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Ok I applied when I was in India so very late May
Jun 04, 2018 6:56pm
Taras Holovko
Late May
Jun 04, 2018 6:56pm
Kevin Stephen
When’d you apply?
Jun 04, 2018 6:56pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah I heard 4 weeks late
Jun 04, 2018 6:55pm
Taras Holovko
Oh damn
Jun 04, 2018 6:55pm
Kevin Stephen
I applied a bit late and never heard back
Jun 04, 2018 6:53pm
Kevin Stephen
That being said I’d take the MS tech superday any day in my current position haha
Jun 04, 2018 6:53pm
Kevin Stephen
But still you’re just helping someone else build their dream, not actually building your own
Jun 04, 2018 6:52pm
Kevin Stephen
And like building the future
Jun 04, 2018 6:52pm
Kevin Stephen
It’s all about curve shifting ideas
Jun 04, 2018 6:51pm
Kevin Stephen
I do think VC is really cool though
Jun 04, 2018 6:51pm
Taras Holovko
It's really easy to get detailed
Jun 04, 2018 6:51pm
Taras Holovko
Three finance internships deep
Jun 04, 2018 6:51pm
Taras Holovko
And keeping me in check
Jun 04, 2018 6:51pm
Taras Holovko
Thanks for saying that
Jun 04, 2018 6:51pm
Taras Holovko
Yes
Jun 04, 2018 6:51pm
Kevin Stephen
I’m very wary of that kind of future
Jun 04, 2018 6:49pm
Kevin Stephen
Never leave finance I mean
Jun 04, 2018 6:48pm
Kevin Stephen
And there are a lot of people capable of that who instead go into banking and never leave
Jun 04, 2018 6:48pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I mean the way I see it we only have a short time when we’re young to have crazy ambitions and actually change the world for the better
😍Taras Holovko
Jun 04, 2018 6:48pm
Taras Holovko
more of a social life too
Jun 04, 2018 6:47pm
Taras Holovko
Idk man I think I'd rather take a $50K paycut, and probably more down the road, to go into something I find more meaningful
Jun 04, 2018 6:47pm
Taras Holovko
Consulting doesn't have that
Jun 04, 2018 6:47pm
Taras Holovko
and paycheck size is big too
Jun 04, 2018 6:47pm
Taras Holovko
Is considered very different from someone going to a KKR or BX
Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Taras Holovko
Someone who goes to middle market PE fund
Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Taras Holovko
Like if you go to a bank
Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Taras Holovko

Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko

Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Taras Holovko
All focused on who wears what suits and shoes
👎Kevin Stephen
Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Taras Holovko
it's sort of disturbing
Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Taras Holovko
I just don't like the culture in finance dude
Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Taras Holovko
I highly value your opinion lmao
Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah definitely
Jun 04, 2018 6:46pm
Taras Holovko
You'd take MBB over any finance right
Jun 04, 2018 6:45pm
Kevin Stephen
I would take Bain over it
Jun 04, 2018 6:45pm
Taras Holovko
versus Bain?
Jun 04, 2018 6:45pm
Kevin Stephen
I think it’s worth it yeah
Jun 04, 2018 6:45pm
Taras Holovko
It's best tech IB office in the world
Jun 04, 2018 6:45pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah
Jun 04, 2018 6:44pm
Taras Holovko
Do u think it is worthwhile to pursue at all or no
Jun 04, 2018 6:44pm
Kevin Stephen
In CA?
Jun 04, 2018 6:44pm
Taras Holovko

Jun 04, 2018 6:43pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko
Til 7 or 8
Jun 04, 2018 6:43pm
Kevin Stephen
How long do they have you in every day?
Jun 04, 2018 6:43pm
Taras Holovko
Most of office time feels like sitting around tbh
Jun 04, 2018 6:42pm
Taras Holovko
And study in the office
Jun 04, 2018 6:42pm
Taras Holovko
I'm going to study hard at night
Jun 04, 2018 6:42pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko
But yeah
Jun 04, 2018 6:42pm
Taras Holovko
I have til 14th
Jun 04, 2018 6:42pm

Taras Holovko

Jun 04, 2018 6:41pm
Taras Holovko

Jun 04, 2018 6:41pm
Taras Holovko
Okay PE
Jun 04, 2018 6:41pm
Taras Holovko
If you want to be rich and in a prestigious role
Jun 04, 2018 6:41pm
Kevin Stephen
I also have company founding hopes
Jun 04, 2018 6:41pm
Taras Holovko
like working rn at Parthenon is cool but it's really 100% about money
Jun 04, 2018 6:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah that’s what I told cj yesterday when he asked me
Jun 04, 2018 6:41pm
Taras Holovko
And I don't want my life to be all about money
Jun 04, 2018 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
PE is all about money
👍Kevin Stephen
Jun 04, 2018 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
but I think I would go consulting
Jun 04, 2018 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
Idk how to weigh finance options vs them
Jun 04, 2018 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
very nervous and stressed lol
Jun 04, 2018 6:40pm
Kevin Stephen

Jun 04, 2018 6:39pm
Taras Holovko

Jun 04, 2018 6:37pm
Kevin Stephen
I don’t know enough to say
May 25, 2018 1:59am
Taras Holovko
In 2 years of IB
May 25, 2018 1:59am
Taras Holovko
Idk I think you learn a lot
May 25, 2018 1:59am
Taras Holovko
I remember you shitting on goldman or whatever over break
May 25, 2018 1:59am
Taras Holovko
for sure man
May 25, 2018 1:58am
Kevin Stephen
Analyst programs are just field training for going at it yourself
May 25, 2018 1:56am
Kevin Stephen
My answer would be there are few people with enough capital or experience to start a good company straight out of college
May 25, 2018 1:56am
Kevin Stephen
Haha that’s an easy answer
May 25, 2018 1:55am
Taras Holovko
Better than starting a company that goes to 0 and making no money lol
May 25, 2018 1:55am
Taras Holovko
:D
May 25, 2018 1:54am
Kevin Stephen
You sent a photo.

May 25, 2018 1:50am
Taras Holovko

May 25, 2018 1:16am
Taras Holovko
Yeah maybe
May 25, 2018 1:16am
Kevin Stephen
Shows commitment
May 25, 2018 1:08am
Kevin Stephen
It definitely helps to build up a relationship with people in the office you’re interested in
May 25, 2018 1:08am
Taras Holovko
It's more meritocratic than banking
May 25, 2018 1:07am
Taras Holovko
Nah they don't care that much
May 25, 2018 1:07am
Kevin Stephen
Contacts
May 25, 2018 1:06am
Taras Holovko

May 25, 2018 1:06am
Kevin Stephen

May 25, 2018 1:06am
Taras Holovko
Do consulting and get in later
May 25, 2018 1:05am
Taras Holovko
It's all sourcing
May 25, 2018 1:05am
Taras Holovko
VC blows at entry level man
May 25, 2018 1:05am
Taras Holovko
Don't do VC lol
May 25, 2018 1:05am
Kevin Stephen
VC has great exit options
May 25, 2018 1:05am
Kevin Stephen
Idk
May 25, 2018 1:05am
Taras Holovko
I think going buyside cuts career development potential
May 25, 2018 1:04am
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha that’s a great compliment
May 25, 2018 1:03am
Taras Holovko
I think you belong at McKinsey dude
May 25, 2018 1:03am
Kevin Stephen
Buy side still remains
May 25, 2018 1:03am
Taras Holovko
Morgan stanley, lazard, and centerview are left
May 25, 2018 1:02am
Taras Holovko
Dude banks are moving quick
May 25, 2018 1:01am
Taras Holovko
Although I did interview with their RX group and that was brutal lol, didn't make it past round 1
May 25, 2018 1:01am
Taras Holovko
No RX
May 25, 2018 1:01am
Taras Holovko
I mean EVR is as technical as it gets
May 25, 2018 1:00am
Taras Holovko
Advanced accounting
May 25, 2018 1:00am
Kevin Stephen
Ok yeah makes sense
May 25, 2018 1:00am
Taras Holovko
Mostly merger model Q's
May 25, 2018 1:00am
Taras Holovko
Merger models, LBOs, MACRS depreciation
May 25, 2018 1:00am
Kevin Stephen
Like banking and restructuring technical questions?

Kevin Stephen

May 25, 2018 1:00am
Kevin Stephen

May 25, 2018 12:59am
Taras Holovko
Since their placement is top of the street
May 25, 2018 12:55am
Taras Holovko
Great path to KKR tech or TPG growth
May 25, 2018 12:55am
Taras Holovko
I mean evercore TMT is awesome too
May 25, 2018 12:55am
Taras Holovko
I don't think it matters that much
May 25, 2018 12:55am
Kevin Stephen
If you’re into tech I’d take BCG
May 25, 2018 12:53am
Taras Holovko
I think I'd take bain and McKinsey over evercore but idk about BCG
May 25, 2018 12:53am
Taras Holovko
Looking for a BCG plug rn lol
May 25, 2018 12:52am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah that’s a good idea
May 25, 2018 12:52am
Taras Holovko
So that's my plan rn
May 25, 2018 12:52am
Taras Holovko
Alex is connecting me w NYC recruiter to see if we can expedite
May 25, 2018 12:51am
Kevin Stephen
Because MBB is hard to get
May 25, 2018 12:51am
Kevin Stephen
Yours is a tough position to be in though
May 25, 2018 12:51am
Kevin Stephen
I’ve kind of put my life into it over the last five months
May 25, 2018 12:50am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah definitely

May 25, 2018 12:49am
Taras Holovko
It's scary
May 25, 2018 12:49am
Taras Holovko
They pay so much fucking money man
May 25, 2018 12:49am
Kevin Stephen
But on the other hand it’s a great position
May 25, 2018 12:48am
Taras Holovko
haha you said the opposite a few months ago
May 25, 2018 12:48am
Kevin Stephen
Hmm I would rather do consulting than investment banking
May 25, 2018 12:48am
Taras Holovko
Haha yeah man

Kevin Stephen
That’s really soon

Jan 15, 2018 7:31pm
Kevin Stephen

Jan 15, 2018 7:31pm
Taras Holovko

Jan 15, 2018 7:30pm
Kevin Stephen
that's what he said to us last week
Jan 15, 2018 7:29pm
Kevin Stephen
"I'm here to build, build, build"
Jan 15, 2018 7:29pm
Kevin Stephen
in the words of Jamie Dimon
Jan 15, 2018 7:29pm
Kevin Stephen
not meaningful work
Jan 15, 2018 7:29pm
Taras Holovko
that sounds about right
Jan 15, 2018 7:29pm
Kevin Stephen
securities
Jan 15, 2018 7:29pm
Kevin Stephen
particularly not algorithms to sell securiites
Jan 15, 2018 7:29pm
Kevin Stephen

Jan 15, 2018 7:29pm
Taras Holovko
haha i looked at the textbook
Jan 15, 2018 7:28pm
Kevin Stephen
stat 123 is hard
Jan 15, 2018 7:28pm

Jan 15, 2018 7:27pm
Kevin Stephen
i don't know what the right thing to do for a winternship is

Jan 15, 2018 7:26pm
Taras Holovko

Jan 15, 2018 7:25pm
Kevin Stephen

Jan 15, 2018 7:24pm
Kevin Stephen

Jan 15, 2018 7:24pm
Taras Holovko
lol
Jan 15, 2018 7:24pm
Taras Holovko
all the good bio kids are going to med school not corporate america
Jan 15, 2018 7:24pm
Taras Holovko
so i think i'm going to keep playing that game
Jan 15, 2018 7:24pm
Taras Holovko
i think my #1 advantage is biotech
Jan 15, 2018 7:24pm
Taras Holovko
yes
Jan 15, 2018 7:24pm
Kevin Stephen

Jan 15, 2018 7:23pm
Kevin Stephen
trying to take this semester a bit easier
Jan 15, 2018 7:23pm
Taras Holovko
but that's sort of a joke i hear lol
Jan 15, 2018 7:23pm
Taras Holovko
i'd consider stat 107
Jan 15, 2018 7:23pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah
Jan 15, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
109 and 104 are easy
Jan 15, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
123,171,111 are hard
Jan 15, 2018 7:22pm
Taras Holovko
there's no moderate level stat classes for spring
Jan 15, 2018 7:22pm
Kevin Stephen
i've heard it's not too hard
Jan 15, 2018 7:21pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah
Jan 15, 2018 7:21pm
Taras Holovko
i'm planning on 139 in the fall
Jan 15, 2018 7:21pm
Taras Holovko
right
Jan 15, 2018 7:21pm
Kevin Stephen
like it's inference
Jan 15, 2018 7:21pm
Kevin Stephen
not really applied
Jan 15, 2018 7:21pm
Kevin Stephen
i mean just like 110
Jan 15, 2018 7:21pm
Taras Holovko
oh really
Jan 15, 2018 7:20pm
Kevin Stephen
vs like 139
Jan 15, 2018 7:20pm
Kevin Stephen
111 is pretty theoretical
Jan 15, 2018 7:20pm
Taras Holovko
stat theory?
Jan 15, 2018 7:20pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah
Jan 15, 2018 7:20pm
Kevin Stephen

Jan 15, 2018 7:20pm
Taras Holovko
a little hesitant to jump into 111
Jan 15, 2018 7:20pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko
you're probably right
May 23, 2017 3:58pm
Kevin Stephen
I think that holds true for most high schools
May 23, 2017 2:55pm
Taras Holovko
And I felt constrained
May 23, 2017 2:55pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah I just kinda got the vibe SJ was a prison
May 23, 2017 2:55pm
Kevin Stephen
But I appreciate many of the people there nonetheless
May 23, 2017 2:54pm
Kevin Stephen
High school was a straining time in many different ways for me and it's not always easy going back and seeing things
May 23, 2017 2:54pm
Kevin Stephen
No I understand that
May 23, 2017 2:54pm
Taras Holovko
In fact, anything but that tbh
May 23, 2017 2:53pm
Taras Holovko
But overall I was driving by the other day and I just did not get swept by a wave of positive emotion
May 23, 2017 2:53pm
Kevin Stephen
Students like us are also St. Joe's most effective marketing tool and they should be looking to capitalize on that logically
May 23, 2017 2:53pm
Taras Holovko
Obviously I owe a lot to st Joe's and its flexibility and certain great people here and there
May 23, 2017 2:53pm
Kevin Stephen
And wants to build a relationship with us
May 23, 2017 2:52pm
Taras Holovko
Yes he does
May 23, 2017 2:52pm
Kevin Stephen
But I think he actually cares about our input
May 23, 2017 2:52pm
Taras Holovko
That's right
May 23, 2017 2:52pm
Kevin Stephen
Money? I'm sure they'll ask for it eventually when we're older
May 23, 2017 2:52pm
Taras Holovko
Haha
May 23, 2017 2:49pm
Taras Holovko
You know why he's keeping in touch so closely with you and me right
May 23, 2017 2:49pm
Kevin Stephen
He said he's much more concerned with quality than quantity of students
May 23, 2017 2:48pm
Kevin Stephen
They actually rejected quite a few people this year though e said
May 23, 2017 2:48pm
Kevin Stephen
About the same as last year he said

Apr 09, 2017 11:43pm
Kevin Stephen
it's much moreso "why does this phenomenon work in Case A but not case b? what are the merits of this theory vs the other"
Apr 09, 2017 11:43pm
Kevin Stephen
or try to engage with the semantics of what he's saying
Apr 09, 2017 11:42pm
Kevin Stephen
i have very little room to try to gauge why an author writes something per say

Mar 30, 2017 5:57pm
Kevin Stephen

same
Feb 14, 2017 9:01pm
Kevin Stephen
like apparently i did this for both datamatch and numbersex
Feb 14, 2017 9:01pm
Kevin Stephen
i have no idea what happened
Feb 14, 2017 9:01pm
Kevin Stephen
lolol
Feb 14, 2017 9:00pm
Taras Holovko
Because I did the exact same thing LOL
Feb 14, 2017 8:51pm
Taras Holovko
it's funny
Feb 14, 2017 8:51pm
Taras Holovko
Dude I hear you put you're into guys on datamatch
Feb 14, 2017 8:51pm
Taras Holovko
And that we were so able to sort through and handpick them
Feb 12, 2017 10:55pm
Taras Holovko
Given how high level analysts are
Feb 12, 2017 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Completely agree
Feb 12, 2017 10:55pm
Taras Holovko
going through this whole process has made me realize the importance of indexing more time to CBE this semester and guiding the case process
Feb 12, 2017 10:15pm
Kevin Stephen
But I couldn't have done anything more. That was my best effort
Jan 06, 2017 3:18am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I was really sad
Jan 06, 2017 3:18am
Taras Holovko
Fuck this class
Jan 05, 2017 4:11pm
Taras Holovko
that doesn't make any sense
Jan 05, 2017 4:11pm
Taras Holovko
Wtf
Jan 05, 2017 4:10pm
Kevin Stephen
i didn't get an A i got a B+
Jan 05, 2017 1:02pm
Kevin Stephen
sorry no
Jan 05, 2017 1:02pm
Kevin Stephen
You: 󰀀

Jan 05, 2017 11:07am
Taras Holovko
Did you get an A
Jan 04, 2017 7:35pm
Taras Holovko
We also spent disproportionately far more time than for any of the p-sets
Jan 04, 2017 2:29am
Taras Holovko
I don't think it's fair to say Jonathan and I were at fault in the project, though. We lost the point for correctness probably because of Facebook and we poured hours into that
Jan 04, 2017 2:29am
Taras Holovko
despite missing only 3 points on the p-sets throughout the class
Jan 04, 2017 1:59am
Taras Holovko
I also got an A- in CS50
Jan 04, 2017 1:58am
Taras Holovko
Nice congrats
Jan 03, 2017 12:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Yep I am
Jan 03, 2017 9:46am
Taras Holovko
Are you
Jan 03, 2017 6:27am
Taras Holovko
Ended up applying for it
Jan 03, 2017 3:07am
Taras Holovko
Yes
Jan 03, 2017 3:07am
Kevin Stephen
Are you an MD for CBE next term
Jan 02, 2017 10:21pm
Kevin Stephen
Hm yeah me too
Dec 26, 2016 3:44pm
Taras Holovko
To really figure that out
Dec 26, 2016 3:44pm
Taras Holovko
That's one of the goals of my winter break I guess
Dec 26, 2016 3:44pm
Kevin Stephen
What else are you doing besides those two
Dec 26, 2016 3:44pm
Kevin Stephen
Ah ok
Dec 26, 2016 3:44pm
Taras Holovko
No I didn't unfortunately
Dec 26, 2016 3:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Did you get the HCCG promotion you were interviewing for
Dec 26, 2016 3:43pm
Taras Holovko
I enjoy it in some ways, but I'm looking for other clubs where I can step up
Dec 26, 2016 3:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Really I thought you loved it
Dec 26, 2016 3:42pm
Taras Holovko
You could say that I suppose, yeah
Dec 26, 2016 3:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Like HCCG?
Dec 26, 2016 3:42pm
Taras Holovko
Dissatisfaction with other commitments
Dec 26, 2016 3:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Really why the change of heart
Dec 26, 2016 3:41pm
Taras Holovko
I'm not really sure, still thinking about it
Dec 26, 2016 3:40pm
Taras Holovko
I most likely am
Dec 26, 2016 3:39pm
Kevin Stephen
are you sticking with CBE?
Dec 26, 2016 3:05pm
Kevin Stephen
Unfortunately it doesn't look like I got it
Dec 21, 2016 7:30am
Kevin Stephen
Which is supposed to be the easiest A of the course
Dec 21, 2016 7:30am
Kevin Stephen
I just needed an A on the project to balance everything out
Dec 21, 2016 7:30am
Kevin Stephen
Everything is A range but the midterm which puts me solidly on the fence
Dec 21, 2016 7:27am
Kevin Stephen
Don't need my TF to tell me I weighed it out approximately myself using the mean scores from exams
Dec 21, 2016 7:26am
Taras Holovko
Did your tf tell you that you're borderline between A and A-
Dec 21, 2016 7:22am
Taras Holovko
Okay
Dec 21, 2016 7:22am
Kevin Stephen
I hope not but as pset grading works a point off on correctness is much more than a point off
Dec 21, 2016 7:22am
Taras Holovko
I don't think 1 point missing will really change much hopefully
Dec 21, 2016 7:21am
Kevin Stephen
Project is the deciding factor
Dec 21, 2016 7:20am
Kevin Stephen
The remaining grade is on the border between A- and A
Dec 21, 2016 7:20am
Taras Holovko
The project is only 10% of the grade
Dec 21, 2016 7:20am
Kevin Stephen
It'll come down to the project
Dec 21, 2016 7:19am
Kevin Stephen
Only grade I have remaining is CS
Dec 21, 2016 7:19am
Kevin Stephen
Congrats
Dec 21, 2016 7:19am
Taras Holovko
I did
Dec 21, 2016 3:01am
Taras Holovko
Yes
Dec 21, 2016 3:01am
Kevin Stephen
Did you get an email from Levitsky
Dec 20, 2016 10:36pm
Taras Holovko
Chaudhry* not varshney
Dec 14, 2016 11:36am
Taras Holovko
So I would probably argue that developing state strength through taxation and an effective coercive apparatus (Fukuyama) is key--and thereby creating the right institutions that allow markets to undertake economic growth (Varsnhey) (prze and limongi)
Dec 14, 2016 11:36am
Taras Holovko
State building occurs only when elites have enough incentive to come together and to tax
Dec 14, 2016 11:34am
Taras Holovko
Autocracies in the Middle East have survived due to Econ stability, intnatl support network, foreign aid, patriomonialism of the coercive apparatus, and low levels of popular mobilization
Dec 14, 2016 11:34am
Taras Holovko
Revolutions tend to produce the most long lasting regimes
Dec 14, 2016 11:33am
Kevin Stephen
a bit along the lines of sheri berman in lessons from europe
Dec 14, 2016 11:32am
Kevin Stephen
i took a stance that incorporated institutionalism and structuralism
Dec 14, 2016 11:32am
Taras Holovko
Did you integrate multiple theories or
Dec 14, 2016 11:31am
Taras Holovko
I'm just unsure how one would even argue that
Dec 14, 2016 11:31am
Taras Holovko
That's quite a lot
Dec 14, 2016 11:31am
Taras Holovko
hm
Dec 14, 2016 11:30am
Kevin Stephen
e.g. After effectively toppling a dictatorial regime, how should elites in Syria/Iraq make the move to democracy? Do existing conditions in the Mideast prevent democratization from occurring? incorporates revolution, state-building, and democratization readings
Dec 14, 2016 11:30am
Taras Holovko

Nov 23, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah let's do that
Nov 23, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
I think I might just skim everything
Nov 23, 2016 10:51pm
Kevin Stephen
But if you want me to make summaries of half of them I can do that
Nov 23, 2016 10:43pm
Kevin Stephen
I mean I'll still be skimming/reading everything bc of the final
Nov 23, 2016 10:43pm
Taras Holovko
do you want to split the reading for gov for last week and next week
Nov 23, 2016 9:50pm

Oct 27, 2016 6:14pm

Aug 12, 2016 10:27pm
Taras Holovko
(y)
Aug 12, 2016 10:27pm
Taras Holovko
same thing with getting lean
Aug 12, 2016 10:27pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm sure it's valid just want to read more into it before I change my program
Aug 12, 2016 10:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Lmao good analogy I like that
Aug 12, 2016 10:27pm
Taras Holovko
like college admissions
Aug 12, 2016 10:26pm
Taras Holovko
misconceptions
Aug 12, 2016 10:26pm
Taras Holovko
fitness magazines and such
Aug 12, 2016 10:26pm
Taras Holovko
the idea that you need to spend 5-6 days in the gym a week is just a product of mass misinformation
Aug 12, 2016 10:26pm
Taras Holovko
try it and see
Aug 12, 2016 10:26pm
Taras Holovko
anyway idc
Aug 12, 2016 10:26pm
Taras Holovko
and then pull up count and stuff
Aug 12, 2016 10:26pm
Taras Holovko
one of the exercises was jump squats, and my vertical increased actually, which was cool
Aug 12, 2016 10:26pm
Kevin Stephen
I hear u
Aug 12, 2016 10:25pm
Taras Holovko
after 3-4 weeks of messing around with CJ
Aug 12, 2016 10:25pm
Taras Holovko
was highly effective
Aug 12, 2016 10:25pm
Kevin Stephen
Which means he had a great elementary strength base
Aug 12, 2016 10:25pm
Taras Holovko
even the bodyweight program from kinobody
Aug 12, 2016 10:25pm
Taras Holovko
i mean
Aug 12, 2016 10:24pm
Taras Holovko
hm yeah
Aug 12, 2016 10:24pm
Kevin Stephen
Like Chris also did 5x5 a whole year before he started kinobody
Aug 12, 2016 10:24pm
Taras Holovko
i liked that
Aug 12, 2016 10:24pm
Taras Holovko
bunch of people w great results
Aug 12, 2016 10:24pm
Taras Holovko
look at the reviews on the site
Aug 12, 2016 10:24pm
Kevin Stephen
So I'll have to look more into it
Aug 12, 2016 10:24pm
Taras Holovko
yeah i was too
Aug 12, 2016 10:24pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm usually skeptical of any programs that promise max return with min input
Aug 12, 2016 10:24pm
Kevin Stephen
I mean I don't know
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
then i throw in pistol squats, calf raises, and core exercises
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
you can probably do it in 30-45 min if you stick to essentials
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
not even that
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
that's it
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
3 hours a week
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
for 5 days a week
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Pun intended
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
no 2 hour gym days
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
it's just so clean cut
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Ok I'll finish reading and researching it tonight
Aug 12, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 12, 2016 10:22pm
Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko

Aug 12, 2016 10:22pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 12, 2016 10:22pm
Kevin Stephen
I haven't tried that
Aug 12, 2016 10:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Ohh ok

Kevin Stephen
Hbu
Aug 12, 2016 10:21pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 12, 2016 10:21pm
Kevin Stephen
55-60 pound Dumbbells
Aug 12, 2016 10:21pm
Kevin Stephen
Flat press like 135 for 4x5
Aug 12, 2016 10:21pm
Kevin Stephen
Benching hahaha I'm weak as hell
Aug 12, 2016 10:20pm
Taras Holovko
what weight do u use anyhow
Aug 12, 2016 10:20pm
Taras Holovko
i'm gonna switch to dumbbell press when i plateau on incline bench
Aug 12, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
It's all mental probably
Aug 12, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
Just not flat
Aug 12, 2016 10:19pm
Taras Holovko
yeah i feel that
Aug 12, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
Incline alone is fine for me
Aug 12, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
Alone I mostly do dumbbell press
Aug 12, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah that prob wouldn't be too bad at a Harvard gym
Aug 12, 2016 10:19pm
Taras Holovko
i can just ask someone random to spot me
Aug 12, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
everything else is fine
Aug 12, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
it's just benching
Aug 12, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
hm maybe you're right
Aug 12, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
i came to the gym to kill it, not to chat
Aug 12, 2016 10:17pm
Kevin Stephen
But benching alone is just mad stressful
Aug 12, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
yeah exactly
Aug 12, 2016 10:17pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes working out alone is twice as fast
Aug 12, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
so like i don't jeopardize myself too much lol
Aug 12, 2016 10:17pm
Kevin Stephen
Right ok
Aug 12, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
only 5 rep
Aug 12, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
i also don't ever do 1 rep maxes
Aug 12, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
i know my maxes
Aug 12, 2016 10:16pm
Kevin Stephen
Also true but how do you bench w/o a spotter
Aug 12, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
when i went with CJ, we would spend more time talking than lifting
Aug 12, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
like same thing with running
Aug 12, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
and get into my head
Aug 12, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
it's one hour to just think alone yk
Aug 12, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
like for me
Aug 12, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
tbh i don't like working out with other people though
Aug 12, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
oh lol yeah
Aug 12, 2016 10:15pm
Kevin Stephen
We have adjacent dorms
Aug 12, 2016 10:14pm
Taras Holovko
adjacent dorms?
Aug 12, 2016 10:14pm
Kevin Stephen
It might be gym bro szn
Aug 12, 2016 10:13pm
Kevin Stephen
And adjacent dorms
Aug 12, 2016 10:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah

Taras Holovko

Aug 12, 2016 10:04pm
Kevin Stephen
Of your waist?
Aug 12, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
it's fun
Aug 12, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
to track progress
Aug 12, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
i take measurements too
Aug 12, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
gotcha
Aug 12, 2016 10:03pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes it's great for keeping track of weight and reps
Aug 12, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
s
Aug 12, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
maybe i should start using it to track workout
Aug 12, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
oh is it useful?
Aug 12, 2016 10:03pm
Kevin Stephen
App
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Kevin Stephen
The all
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Kevin Stephen
I use RepCount
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I mean CJ and I have just been going to the gym and lifting things haha
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
it's my new running
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
haha i'm starting to take this all way too seriously
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm going tomorrow morning
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
same thing
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
yeah plateau
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Kevin Stephen
Oh almost like plateau
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
it's time to switch to weighted dips
Aug 12, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
and then can't get to 195 for a few weeks
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
like say i keep improving till 190
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
Stall out
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
then will switch to weighted dips
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
What does that mean
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
will do that until i stall out
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
same thing with incline bench
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
i'm going to do chin-ups until i stall out
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
Dense
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
They make biceps feel mad sense
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
no i just started
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
Have u tried
Aug 12, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
it doesn't matter
Aug 12, 2016 10:00pm
Taras Holovko
you can do pull-ups with hands facing away
Aug 12, 2016 10:00pm
Kevin Stephen
Static holds are also really good for biceps though
Aug 12, 2016 10:00pm
Kevin Stephen
True
Aug 12, 2016 10:00pm
Taras Holovko
it's the best way to grow your lats
Aug 12, 2016 10:00pm
Taras Holovko
+ plates
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
your biceps can't lift your bodyweight
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
it's not purely biceps
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
think about it this way
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
i mean like
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Bc I do the close grip ones for biceps
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
just normal grip
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
no it doesn't matter
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Ok so these are wider grip chin-ups
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
it's only slightly biceps
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
chin ups don't really activate biceps as much as back
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Kevin Stephen
No it's comfortable
Aug 12, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
well not really
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Ok so biceps
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Taras Holovko
not pull ups
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Taras Holovko
chin ups
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Kevin Stephen
But yeah biceps or back
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Taras Holovko
it probably wouldn't be that comfortable I'm guessing
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Kevin Stephen
No idt it would
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Taras Holovko
or would it like rip with 100 lbs on it
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Kevin Stephen
And yes it's good
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Kevin Stephen
I find wide grip pull-ups really hard
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Taras Holovko
ok is it high quality
Aug 12, 2016 9:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Yep
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Taras Holovko
does retro have one?
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes belt
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Are these the wide grip pull-ups for lats or close grip for biceps?
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Taras Holovko
do you use a belt or something for the weight?
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Haven't tried pull-ups yet but will
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Kevin Stephen
CJ and I started going weighted dips
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Taras Holovko
highly recommend
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Taras Holovko
those are actually great
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Kevin Stephen
I know there was a pull-up bar
Aug 12, 2016 9:57pm
Taras Holovko
seeing as i do weighted pull ups now
Aug 12, 2016 9:56pm
Taras Holovko
is whether they have pull up belts
Aug 12, 2016 9:56pm
Taras Holovko
my other question
Aug 12, 2016 9:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Better than retro haha
Aug 12, 2016 9:56pm
Kevin Stephen
It's a great gym dude
Aug 12, 2016 9:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I felt like the smaller ones were there
Aug 12, 2016 9:56pm
Taras Holovko
but luckily i was able to find the answer online -- it does
Aug 12, 2016 9:56pm
Taras Holovko
i don't need them yet since i'm not anywhere close to plateauing
Aug 12, 2016 9:55pm
Taras Holovko
i'm going to buy 1/2, 1 lb plates eventually
Aug 12, 2016 9:55pm
Taras Holovko
yes sir
Aug 12, 2016 9:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Is that what it's called
Aug 12, 2016 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Im pretty sure Hemenway did I wouldn't be able to tell you for sure bc I wasn't microloading
Aug 12, 2016 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
That is an important q
Aug 12, 2016 9:32pm
Kevin Stephen
Sorry was driving
Aug 12, 2016 9:32pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Aug 12, 2016 9:00pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 12, 2016 9:00pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 01, 2016 1:23pm
Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen
But CS50, Econ, Hindi, maybe multi?
Aug 01, 2016 1:21pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko
wish there was something more along the lines of management and leadership
Aug 01, 2016 1:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Like finance is too application based
Aug 01, 2016 1:13pm
Taras Holovko
okay
Aug 01, 2016 1:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Because you understand how the economy operates and how firms function
Aug 01, 2016 1:13pm
Kevin Stephen
It's a good theoretical and practical setup for finance work
Aug 01, 2016 1:13pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 01, 2016 1:13pm
Taras Holovko

Jun 02, 2016 12:39am
Taras Holovko
for some sort of development
Jun 02, 2016 12:39am
Taras Holovko

Jun 02, 2016 12:39am
Kevin Stephen
yeah same for you dude
Jun 02, 2016 12:39am
Taras Holovko
i can see where you're coming from
Jun 02, 2016 12:38am
Taras Holovko
yeah
Jun 02, 2016 12:38am
Kevin Stephen
passive isn't a great word either but after brittany i'll take it lol
Jun 02, 2016 12:38am
Kevin Stephen
hmm not defeatist just passive
Jun 02, 2016 12:38am
Taras Holovko
can't say anything yet
Jun 02, 2016 12:37am
Taras Holovko
i'll see how this goes anyhow
Jun 02, 2016 12:37am
Taras Holovko
rather than active
Jun 02, 2016 12:37am
Taras Holovko
defeatist approach maybe
Jun 02, 2016 12:37am
Taras Holovko
that is exactly why it's hard for them to be exceeded
Jun 02, 2016 12:37am
Kevin Stephen
that is my plan
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Taras Holovko
wait
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Kevin Stephen
just wait for standards to be exceeded
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Taras Holovko
because i don't know what's out there
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Taras Holovko
for someone
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Kevin Stephen
not settle
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Taras Holovko
than settle
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Taras Holovko
i'd rather actively select a mate
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Kevin Stephen
personally don't think it works for relationships but that is me
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Kevin Stephen
yes i have heard the candy/cake analogy haha
Jun 02, 2016 12:36am
Taras Holovko
and settle for one for the rest of your life
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Taras Holovko
neither of which is that good
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Taras Holovko
than try 2
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Taras Holovko
and pick out the one you enjoy most
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Kevin Stephen
about relationships and the like
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Taras Holovko
5 varieties of cake
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Kevin Stephen
idk i've become cynical
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Taras Holovko
to taste
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Taras Holovko
it's better
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Taras Holovko
i don't agree with that
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Taras Holovko
lol
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Kevin Stephen
yes and every sequential relationship loses some uniqueness
Jun 02, 2016 12:35am
Taras Holovko
time and energy ?
Jun 02, 2016 12:34am
Taras Holovko
what cost
Jun 02, 2016 12:34am
Kevin Stephen
agreed but arguably at a cost
Jun 02, 2016 12:34am
Taras Holovko
provides more perspective
Jun 02, 2016 12:34am
Taras Holovko
yeah but doing just that
Jun 02, 2016 12:34am
Kevin Stephen
i don't wish i'd dated around more just wish i didn't care about britt
Jun 02, 2016 12:34am
Taras Holovko
definitely going to do that
Jun 02, 2016 12:34am
Taras Holovko
or jes
Jun 02, 2016 12:33am
Taras Holovko
before becoming attached to sneha
Jun 02, 2016 12:33am
Taras Holovko
i wish i had dated around more
Jun 02, 2016 12:33am
Taras Holovko
it's true though
Jun 02, 2016 12:33am
Taras Holovko
mhm
Jun 02, 2016 12:33am
Kevin Stephen
nice use of chiasmus
Jun 02, 2016 12:33am
Taras Holovko
not let a relationship choose you
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Taras Holovko
to choose a relationship
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Taras Holovko
and that it's best
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Taras Holovko
that there are 3.5 billion other women out there
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Taras Holovko
and realize
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Taras Holovko
but it's better to be rational
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Kevin Stephen
yep wholeheartedly agree
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Taras Holovko
yeah maybe
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Kevin Stephen
would've been 2 years
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Taras Holovko
my life has become much more positive and fruitful without jes in it
Jun 02, 2016 12:32am
Kevin Stephen

Jun 02, 2016 12:31am
Kevin Stephen
agree
Jun 02, 2016 12:31am
Taras Holovko
it's just not worth the energy or time
Jun 02, 2016 12:31am
Kevin Stephen
i get hit with another baffling lie
Jun 02, 2016 12:31am
Taras Holovko
my advice (take w/ a grain of salt): cut it off
Jun 02, 2016 12:31am
Kevin Stephen
because every time i attempt to be good to her
Jun 02, 2016 12:31am
Taras Holovko
then why do you hate her
Jun 02, 2016 12:30am
Kevin Stephen
she's not even worth a discussion
Jun 02, 2016 12:30am
Taras Holovko
brittany problems?
Jun 02, 2016 12:27am
Taras Holovko
why?

Jun 02, 2016 12:21am
Taras Holovko

May 16, 2016 10:16pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen

May 16, 2016 10:16pm
Kevin Stephen
neither of next year's corps are ready yet though so we have to
May 16, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
that's kinda the fundamental structure
May 16, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
every corps shuts down entirely after conf
May 16, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
it shouldn't be 2016 corps doing this

Kevin Stephen

May 11, 2016 10:00am
Taras Holovko
No idea
May 11, 2016 10:00am
Kevin Stephen
seizing opportunity, being impulsive?
May 11, 2016 9:47am
Kevin Stephen

May 11, 2016 9:47am
Kevin Stephen
why not
May 11, 2016 9:47am

May 11, 2016 9:23am
Kevin Stephen

May 11, 2016 9:23am
Taras Holovko
And you do "why not"
May 11, 2016 9:15am
Taras Holovko
Around "why"
May 11, 2016 9:15am
Taras Holovko
I theme mine
May 11, 2016 9:15am
Taras Holovko
What if
May 11, 2016 9:15am
Taras Holovko
Hold up
May 11, 2016 9:15am
Kevin Stephen
questioning purpose
May 11, 2016 8:53am
Kevin Stephen
wdym
May 11, 2016 8:53am
Taras Holovko
And you talk about questioning it
May 11, 2016 8:50am
Taras Holovko
I talk about finding purpose
May 11, 2016 8:50am
Taras Holovko
How about this
May 11, 2016 8:50am
Taras Holovko
Okay
May 11, 2016 8:50am
Kevin Stephen
maybe after that you can shift from focus on you to focus on school/community
May 11, 2016 8:44am
Taras Holovko
What do I say from there? After that part
May 11, 2016 8:43am
Kevin Stephen
ok
May 11, 2016 8:42am
Taras Holovko
And detail
May 11, 2016 8:42am
Taras Holovko
Before I do like the rhetoric
May 11, 2016 8:42am
Taras Holovko
Tryin to figure out the loose structure and direction of it
May 11, 2016 8:42am
Taras Holovko
I'm just like jotting stuff down
May 11, 2016 8:42am
Kevin Stephen
two pages already?
May 11, 2016 8:42am
Taras Holovko
Dude I just want to go back to bed
May 11, 2016 8:40am
Taras Holovko
It's not good
May 11, 2016 8:40am
Taras Holovko
Half idk
May 11, 2016 8:40am
Kevin Stephen
how much have you written already
May 11, 2016 8:40am
Kevin Stephen
good point
May 11, 2016 8:40am
Taras Holovko
right but how do they complement each other then
May 11, 2016 8:32am
Kevin Stephen
Too much
May 11, 2016 8:28am
Kevin Stephen
As long as the messages don't overlap
May 11, 2016 8:28am
Kevin Stephen
It doesn't really need to be chronological
May 11, 2016 8:28am
Taras Holovko
So more about SJ?
May 11, 2016 8:28am
Taras Holovko
Exactly
May 11, 2016 8:27am
Kevin Stephen
That seems forced
May 11, 2016 8:27am
Taras Holovko
Like "go find purpose now"
May 11, 2016 8:27am
Taras Holovko
right but where do I leave off
May 11, 2016 8:27am
Kevin Stephen
My anecdote is short then switches right into outlook and aspiration
May 11, 2016 8:26am
Kevin Stephen
Maybe elaborate on a high school experience
May 11, 2016 8:26am
Kevin Stephen
Well if you need 2m more you can go into your outlook on life
May 11, 2016 8:26am
Kevin Stephen
Hmm
May 11, 2016 8:26am
Taras Holovko
So what should I wrap up with?
May 11, 2016 8:25am
Kevin Stephen
No it shouldn't be
May 11, 2016 8:25am
Taras Holovko
Because then it doesn't work
May 11, 2016 8:25am
Taras Holovko
of your speech
May 11, 2016 8:25am
Taras Holovko
I just don't want mine to be like the first half
May 11, 2016 8:25am
Kevin Stephen
Actually was thinking about starting w the story of how I quit track
May 11, 2016 8:25am
Taras Holovko
So it works
May 11, 2016 8:25am
Taras Holovko
Your start
May 11, 2016 8:25am
Taras Holovko
Where you will be
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Taras Holovko
So I need to know
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Taras Holovko
I still need 2 min from there
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Taras Holovko
That's like 2 min
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Taras Holovko
well I'm not done there lol
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Kevin Stephen
Flows nicely into my opening
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Kevin Stephen
Right that's good
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Taras Holovko
Isn't so easy
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Taras Holovko
The real world
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Taras Holovko
Purpose is the English essay you wrote, the psych test you took, the math problems you did
May 11, 2016 8:24am
Taras Holovko
High school is filled with certainty
May 11, 2016 8:23am
Kevin Stephen
Nice ok common thread of family exists
May 11, 2016 8:23am
Taras Holovko
and then
May 11, 2016 8:23am
Taras Holovko

May 11, 2016 8:23am
Taras Holovko
Their kid was me
May 11, 2016 8:23am
Taras Holovko
Yad yada
May 11, 2016 8:23am
Taras Holovko

May 11, 2016 8:23am
Taras Holovko

May 11, 2016 8:23am
Taras Holovko
16 years ago Parents came to US seeking a better life
May 11, 2016 8:23am
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

May 08, 2016 8:11am
Taras Holovko
I was gonna use this quote
May 08, 2016 8:11am
Taras Holovko
The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
May 08, 2016 8:11am
Kevin Stephen
But not that serious haha
May 08, 2016 8:10am
Kevin Stephen
Like from my CA "ten day, twelve men, eighty-four miles"

May 08, 2016 8:09am
Kevin Stephen

May 08, 2016 8:09am
Taras Holovko
Don't want it to be just MUN

Taras Holovko
I might do it sophomore year

Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Taras Holovko

Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Kevin Stephen
5 days/week?
Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Taras Holovko
So you only do 3 classes
Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Taras Holovko
And you meet daily for an hour
Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Taras Holovko
If you take Spanish, it counts as two of your classes
Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Taras Holovko
Huge commitment
Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Kevin Stephen
what does that mean
Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Taras Holovko
it's a double class
Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Kevin Stephen
Probs
Apr 29, 2016 2:30pm
Taras Holovko
I'm considering it
Apr 29, 2016 2:29pm
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 2:29pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko
It's meaningless

Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko
She traditionally works with the valedictorian
Apr 29, 2016 2:28pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah I think so
Apr 29, 2016 2:28pm
Kevin Stephen
does gubernat usually direct the speech? i think she'll prob just check for WC lolol

Kevin Stephen
i can do the "commencement"/looking forward speech
Apr 29, 2016 2:28pm
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 2:27pm
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 2:27pm
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 2:19pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah let's do that
Apr 29, 2016 2:19pm
Taras Holovko
And then you continue on to talk more about the future
Apr 29, 2016 2:16pm
Taras Holovko
Like background seguing into where we are now--that anyone can make it in America or something
Apr 29, 2016 2:16pm
Taras Holovko
But maybe that could be the intro speech
Apr 29, 2016 2:16pm
Taras Holovko
Not sure what the overarching message would be
Apr 29, 2016 2:16pm
Taras Holovko
Relate where I came from
Apr 29, 2016 2:15pm
Taras Holovko
Like my background and all
Apr 29, 2016 2:15pm
Taras Holovko
I was hoping to tell my story
Apr 29, 2016 2:15pm
Taras Holovko
What are we doing for baccalaureate
Apr 29, 2016 2:06pm
Taras Holovko
Same
Apr 29, 2016 2:06pm
Kevin Stephen
Hbu
Apr 29, 2016 2:05pm
Kevin Stephen
But want to do the ending speech
Apr 29, 2016 2:05pm
Kevin Stephen
Haven't had time to think about it
Apr 29, 2016 2:05pm
Kevin Stephen
Not really
Apr 29, 2016 2:05pm
Taras Holovko
Do you have an idea of what you want to talk about
Apr 29, 2016 1:08pm
Taras Holovko
Yes
Apr 29, 2016 1:07pm
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 12:37pm

Kevin Stephen
will hit you up later too
Apr 29, 2016 12:05pm
Kevin Stephen
ok thanks v much
Apr 29, 2016 12:05pm
Taras Holovko
Yes I think so
Apr 29, 2016 12:01pm
Kevin Stephen
the interpersonal speaking is always informal right
Apr 29, 2016 12:00pm
Kevin Stephen
I'll do a practice test after lunch and see how I do
Apr 29, 2016 11:59am
Kevin Stephen
Okay good
Apr 29, 2016 11:59am
Taras Holovko
I thought it was very clear
Apr 29, 2016 11:58am
Taras Holovko
Don't remember
Apr 29, 2016 11:58am
Kevin Stephen
because that made it so much harder to understand
Apr 29, 2016 11:58am
Kevin Stephen
does the audio have the annoying music in the background
Apr 29, 2016 11:58am
Taras Holovko
Lol yeah exactly
Apr 29, 2016 11:58am
Kevin Stephen
and you have to find them too
Apr 29, 2016 11:58am
Kevin Stephen
but then there's also choices that have those phrases but they're deceptive
Apr 29, 2016 11:58am
Kevin Stephen
right right
Apr 29, 2016 11:57am
Taras Holovko
And find them in the answer choices
Apr 29, 2016 11:57am
Taras Holovko
You have to listen for particular phrases
Apr 29, 2016 11:57am
Kevin Stephen
ok solid
Apr 29, 2016 11:57am
Taras Holovko
I think we played it twice
Apr 29, 2016 11:57am
Taras Holovko
Ap audio was easier I thought
Apr 29, 2016 11:57am
Kevin Stephen
easier, representative or harder than the exam
Apr 29, 2016 11:57am
Kevin Stephen
is the audio we get in class
Apr 29, 2016 11:57am
Taras Holovko
Both
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Kevin Stephen
or both
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Kevin Stephen
the reading MC or the audio MC
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Taras Holovko
Like I was confident
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Taras Holovko
There were very few questions I didn't know in all of MC
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Kevin Stephen
oh damn how dyk
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Taras Holovko
So that boosted my score
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Taras Holovko
I aced MC
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Taras Holovko
I have no idea
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Kevin Stephen
but you also would've spoken much better for the other ones
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Taras Holovko
Don't do that
Apr 29, 2016 11:56am
Kevin Stephen
lolol i remember
Apr 29, 2016 11:55am
Taras Holovko
Lol I said goodbye on the wrong prompt last year so
Apr 29, 2016 11:55am
Taras Holovko
Yeah
Apr 29, 2016 11:55am
Kevin Stephen
the ideas kind of repeat themselves right
Apr 29, 2016 11:55am
Kevin Stephen
after making this template
Apr 29, 2016 11:55am
Kevin Stephen
did 5 practice prompts this morning
Apr 29, 2016 11:54am
Kevin Stephen
i'm getting much better
Apr 29, 2016 11:54am
Taras Holovko
yeah phone call
Apr 29, 2016 11:54am
Kevin Stephen
thats a good idea
Apr 29, 2016 11:54am
Taras Holovko
Estaba estudiando para los examenes
Apr 29, 2016 11:54am
Kevin Stephen
is it usually a phone call?
Apr 29, 2016 11:54am
Taras Holovko
and I used to say things like "sorry I didn't call back earlier, I was studying for exams"
Apr 29, 2016 11:54am
Kevin Stephen
that was a mishmosh of two lines
Apr 29, 2016 11:53am
Kevin Stephen
o i meant hablar contigo
Apr 29, 2016 11:53am
Taras Holovko
See you with you
Apr 29, 2016 11:53am
Taras Holovko
Verte contigo is also grammatically improper I think
Apr 29, 2016 11:53am
Taras Holovko
"Hey I meant to call you / reach out"
Apr 29, 2016 11:53am
Taras Holovko
I used to say like
Apr 29, 2016 11:53am
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 9:13am
Kevin Stephen
hey dude
Apr 29, 2016 9:13am
Taras Holovko
I just think I've recognized that I don't need to be validated by others
Apr 28, 2016 6:02pm
Kevin Stephen
different life philosophy
Apr 28, 2016 6:01pm
Kevin Stephen
Natural part of living in a community
Apr 28, 2016 6:01pm
Taras Holovko
Idk
Apr 28, 2016 6:01pm
Kevin Stephen
it's good to feel appreciated
Apr 28, 2016 6:00pm
Taras Holovko
Without the learn
Apr 28, 2016 6:00pm
Taras Holovko
Just have to derive
Apr 28, 2016 6:00pm
Taras Holovko
Well not learn
Apr 28, 2016 6:00pm
Kevin Stephen
only you would say that
Apr 28, 2016 6:00pm
Kevin Stephen
LOL
Apr 28, 2016 6:00pm

I thought that was just a rumor
Apr 05, 2016 8:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Really
Apr 05, 2016 8:37pm

Apr 05, 2016 8:27pm
Taras Holovko
Wl Princeton
Apr 05, 2016 8:16pm
Kevin Stephen
Any idea bout Nikhil
Apr 05, 2016 8:16pm
Kevin Stephen
Hm makes sense
Apr 05, 2016 8:15pm
Taras Holovko
By claiming he wasn't interested in matching Zack's legendary legacy
Apr 05, 2016 8:12pm
Taras Holovko
And skirting the shadow
Apr 05, 2016 8:12pm
Taras Holovko
It's more of a means of avoiding comparison to his brother
Apr 05, 2016 8:12pm
Taras Holovko
I think
Apr 05, 2016 8:12pm
Taras Holovko
No
Apr 05, 2016 8:12pm
Kevin Stephen
Similar reasoning to Jeff
Apr 05, 2016 8:12pm
Kevin Stephen
Damn
Apr 05, 2016 8:11pm
Taras Holovko
If he gets a full ride his dad gives him 100k for startup
Apr 05, 2016 8:11pm
Kevin Stephen
Not interested in ivy?
Apr 05, 2016 8:11pm
Taras Holovko
Northeastern or NYU or something
Apr 05, 2016 8:10pm
Kevin Stephen
Which school then
Apr 05, 2016 8:10pm
Kevin Stephen
Lolol I thought you were making a Yale joke
Apr 05, 2016 8:10pm
Taras Holovko
He didn't apply to ivies
Apr 05, 2016 8:09pm
Kevin Stephen
?
Apr 05, 2016 8:09pm
Kevin Stephen
Yale
Apr 05, 2016 8:09pm
Taras Holovko
Some third tier school
Apr 05, 2016 8:09pm
Taras Holovko
He breaks the money mold
Apr 05, 2016 8:09pm
Kevin Stephen
Where's Chris Perkins going to college btw
Apr 05, 2016 8:09pm
Taras Holovko
This is the biggest reason I support Bernie
Apr 05, 2016 8:09pm
Kevin Stephen
But sadly a good part of American politics is owned by corporations
Apr 05, 2016 8:08pm
Kevin Stephen
Malarkey
Apr 05, 2016 8:08pm
Taras Holovko
Because that's bonkers
Apr 05, 2016 8:08pm
Taras Holovko
But I don't agree that we should end free trade
Apr 05, 2016 8:08pm
Taras Holovko
Because America needs a reminder that it's not owned by corporations
Apr 05, 2016 8:07pm
Taras Holovko
Which is why I think he's valuable
Apr 05, 2016 8:07pm
Taras Holovko
And with all that emotion trumps logic
Apr 05, 2016 8:07pm
Taras Holovko
And the ability to turn away corporations
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Taras Holovko
And empathy
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Taras Holovko
But he represents honesty
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Taras Holovko
I question the validity of his economics though
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Kevin Stephen
Uh
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Taras Holovko
He's no worse than JFK
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Taras Holovko
A democratic socialist
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Taras Holovko
Not a socialist
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Taras Holovko
Politicians who care
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Taras Holovko
We deserve
Apr 05, 2016 8:06pm
Kevin Stephen
So I'd argue the opposite
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Taras Holovko
and who recognizes the vast disparity extant in our society
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Kevin Stephen
But I think we do need someone to fix inequality
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Taras Holovko
Who empathizes with the decaying middle class
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Kevin Stephen
Not sure if we "deserve" a socialist considering our principles
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Taras Holovko
He is someone
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Taras Holovko
it's quite true
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Kevin Stephen
Bruh
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Kevin Stephen
But not the one it needs rn
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Taras Holovko
But not the one it needs
Apr 05, 2016 8:05pm
Taras Holovko
The hero America deserves
Apr 05, 2016 8:04pm
Taras Holovko
He's like batman
Apr 05, 2016 8:04pm

This article worries me more re: his economics
Apr 05, 2016 8:04pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I mean I like the style of his campaign and his honesty but
Apr 05, 2016 8:04pm
Taras Holovko
And because he brings people together
Apr 05, 2016 8:04pm
Taras Holovko
Or because he represents something far larger than himself
Apr 05, 2016 8:03pm
Taras Holovko
Is Bernie valuable because of who he is?
Apr 05, 2016 8:03pm
Taras Holovko
But it makes me question
Apr 05, 2016 8:03pm
Taras Holovko
You're right wrong choice of word
Apr 05, 2016 8:03pm
Taras Holovko
Not a demagogue
Apr 05, 2016 8:03pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm
Apr 05, 2016 8:02pm
Kevin Stephen
He's not asking people to act on anger and fear
Apr 05, 2016 8:02pm
Kevin Stephen
Not a demagogue
Apr 05, 2016 8:01pm
Taras Holovko
Then is he a maverick of change or merely a demagogue?
Apr 05, 2016 7:58pm
Taras Holovko
And if it's just empty rhetoric
Apr 05, 2016 7:58pm
Taras Holovko
If his policies are that unsound
Apr 05, 2016 7:58pm
Taras Holovko
But I mean voting for her over sanders
Apr 05, 2016 7:58pm
Taras Holovko
Oh well I do support her
Apr 05, 2016 7:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Are you serious or
Apr 05, 2016 7:57pm
Taras Holovko

Apr 01, 2016 11:12pm
Taras Holovko
As trust
Apr 01, 2016 11:12pm
Taras Holovko
Or not as much honesty
Apr 01, 2016 11:12pm
Taras Holovko
Just honesty eroded over time

Taras Holovko
Long story

Apr 01, 2016 11:11pm
Kevin Stephen
That's like the one thing I couldn't handle
Apr 01, 2016 11:10pm
Taras Holovko
Cornerstone in a relationship
Apr 01, 2016 11:10pm
Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko
I feel like Jes is cheating on me
Apr 01, 2016 11:06pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Apr 01, 2016 10:22pm
Taras Holovko

Apr 01, 2016 10:21pm
Kevin Stephen

Most of the Jeff kids that I know have committed
Mar 30, 2016 10:09pm
Taras Holovko
That's not bad
Mar 30, 2016 9:21pm
Kevin Stephen
More like three hours
Mar 30, 2016 9:20pm

Four or five with breaks

Mar 30, 2016 5:43pm
Kevin Stephen

Mar 30, 2016 4:54pm
Kevin Stephen
undemocratic i think
Mar 30, 2016 4:53pm
Kevin Stephen
its not really a great system
Mar 30, 2016 4:53pm
Kevin Stephen
too long
Mar 30, 2016 4:53pm
Kevin Stephen

Mar 29, 2016 10:29pm
Kevin Stephen
He's not Christian Bale
Mar 29, 2016 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Nah it was him too lol
Mar 29, 2016 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
It was more like how he was scripted and directed
Mar 29, 2016 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
He has some serious acting chops
Mar 29, 2016 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
I don't even think it was Affleck
Mar 29, 2016 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah not even close
Mar 29, 2016 10:22pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah did not live up to the dark knight
Mar 29, 2016 10:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Reminded me of Heath Ledger in the dark knight but like not as good
Mar 29, 2016 10:21pm
Kevin Stephen
Jesse Eisenberg put way too much histrionics into his role
Mar 29, 2016 10:21pm
Kevin Stephen
Think there were some political undertones there
Mar 29, 2016 10:20pm
Kevin Stephen
Superman was like "don't regulate my power when I use it to do good"
Mar 29, 2016 10:20pm
Kevin Stephen
Batman was like "too much power for one man to handle" haha
Mar 29, 2016 10:20pm
Kevin Stephen
Almost like a philosophical conflict of power and regulation
Mar 29, 2016 10:19pm
Taras Holovko
Pls elucidate
Mar 29, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
It was the best part of the movie I thought
Mar 29, 2016 10:19pm
Taras Holovko
What was his intent
Mar 29, 2016 10:19pm
Taras Holovko
Lex Luther kept reminding me of mark zuckerberg
Mar 29, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
Given like the context of his history and all
Mar 29, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm no batman's intent made sense
Mar 29, 2016 10:19pm
Taras Holovko
"He's too powerful so I gotta kill him"
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
Both of them ^^^
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen

Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
It was basically
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
From what I understood
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
Wasn't even a great fight scene
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I know
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
Like their intent
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
The fight between superman and batman was half baked
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah exactly
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
Neither was directing in many parts
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko

Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
Script wasn't good
Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen

Mar 29, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
It was a faithful adaptation
Mar 29, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
I agree, quite lacking
Mar 29, 2016 10:17pm
Kevin Stephen

Mar 29, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
As were some other facets of the plot
Mar 29, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
Wonder Woman was an absolute deus ex machina

Mar 29, 2016 1:01am
Taras Holovko
At least not to the extent the media claims
Mar 29, 2016 1:01am
Taras Holovko
Either way, I think ISIS doesn't profoundly affect us
Mar 29, 2016 1:01am
Taras Holovko
And not just US lives lost
Mar 29, 2016 1:00am
Taras Holovko
By making sure other countries' bear an equal burden
Mar 29, 2016 1:00am
Taras Holovko
His style is to lead from behind
Mar 29, 2016 1:00am
Taras Holovko
Because so many interests are at stake
Mar 29, 2016 1:00am
Taras Holovko
It's not really simplistic, unilateral decisions
Mar 29, 2016 1:00am
Kevin Stephen
Ok I'll lyk after I read
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Taras Holovko
Foreign policy is convoluted
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Taras Holovko
That's very much what he's trying to clean up
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Kevin Stephen
Egypt
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am

Libya
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am

Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Kevin Stephen
And created a few more himself
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Taras Holovko
Well Obama was handed 2 wars
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Taras Holovko
Lol
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Taras Holovko
Than from terrorism
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Kevin Stephen
Interesting but we've done more intervention in the Middle East during his presidency than in any before it
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Taras Holovko
More people die in the US every year by falling into bathtubs
Mar 29, 2016 12:59am
Taras Holovko
Not the Middle East
Mar 29, 2016 12:58am
Taras Holovko
Which will define the 21st century
Mar 29, 2016 12:58am
Taras Holovko
Like Asia
Mar 29, 2016 12:58am
Taras Holovko
And he's focusing more on long term relevant issues
Mar 29, 2016 12:58am
Taras Holovko
There's no solution
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Taras Holovko
And his approach is basically fatalistic
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Taras Holovko
Yeah it's like an hour long read
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Taras Holovko
It's essentially a burden he has to bear
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
Will read tomorrow
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
Probably will
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Taras Holovko
You'll understand a lot after the read
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Taras Holovko
Isn't to focus on the Middle East
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Taras Holovko
The cornerstone of obama's foreign policy
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
Just responded to the quote
Mar 29, 2016 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
Not now later
Mar 29, 2016 12:56am
Taras Holovko
Read the article
Mar 29, 2016 12:56am
Kevin Stephen
Agreed, but to dismiss the largest terror force we've faced in Middle Eastern history as merely urgent and not important is fallacious. We didn't think Al Qaeda was a significant threat either: but they pulled us into a $2 trillion war that effectively spelled the demise of a stable economy that still hasn't fully recovered.

'“isis is not an existential threat to the United States,” he told me in one of these conversations. “Climate change is a potential existential threat to the entire world if we don’t do something about it.” Obama explained that climate change worries him in particular because “it is a political problem perfectly designed to repel government intervention. It involves every single country, and it is a comparatively slow-moving emergency, so there is always something seemingly more urgent on the agenda.”

At the moment, of course, the most urgent of the “seemingly more urgent” issues is Syria. But at any given moment, Obama’s entire presidency could be upended by North Korean aggression, or an assault by Russia on a member of nato, or an isis-planned attack on U.S. soil. Few presidents have faced such diverse tests on the international stage as Obama has, and the challenge for him, as for all presidents, has been to distinguish the merely urgent from the truly important, and to focus on the important.'

Because Kurtz’ demise upends the normalcy of mealtime and the kinship of shared communion for the crew, it reflects his unparalleled importance; Kurtz possesses authority over the natives and pilgrims alike. Marlow’s refusal to depart the mess-room implies that he, having realized Kurtz’ tainted morality and uninhibited megalomania at the Inner Station, attempts to discount the trader’s influence upon his life. However, his loss of appetite indicates that he is veritably affected by the loss; Kurtz—once benevolent, later debauched, and now dead—reflects Marlow’s descent into darkness.

Mar 01, 2016 11:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Bio tough
Mar 01, 2016 11:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Physics won't be too bad
Mar 01, 2016 11:33pm
Taras Holovko
Physics is minimal (?)
Mar 01, 2016 11:32pm
Taras Holovko
Gov is minimal
Mar 01, 2016 11:32pm
Taras Holovko
Lit is no studying
Mar 01, 2016 11:32pm
Taras Holovko
let's see
Mar 01, 2016 11:32pm
Taras Holovko
Need to rest psychologically
Mar 01, 2016 11:32pm
Taras Holovko
I'm not doing 22-23 for the sake of the award
Mar 01, 2016 11:32pm
Kevin Stephen
I was just looking at CC the other day
Mar 01, 2016 11:32pm
Taras Holovko
22-23 is too many
Mar 01, 2016 11:32pm
Taras Holovko
Vinay was 19
Mar 01, 2016 11:31pm
Kevin Stephen
For bigger states
Mar 01, 2016 11:31pm
Taras Holovko
So let's do this for the value
Mar 01, 2016 11:31pm
Kevin Stephen
Usually the number is 22-23
Mar 01, 2016 11:31pm
Taras Holovko
Ok
Mar 01, 2016 11:31pm
Kevin Stephen
Well then we lose
Mar 01, 2016 11:31pm
Taras Holovko
Lol what if there's another kid with 20+
Mar 01, 2016 11:31pm
Kevin Stephen
Also what if there's another kid w 19
Mar 01, 2016 11:31pm
Taras Holovko
How much studying do you think we'll need for physics
Mar 01, 2016 11:31pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah it's interesting
Mar 01, 2016 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
And it's v interesting stuff
Mar 01, 2016 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
I heard it's not that bad though
Mar 01, 2016 11:30pm
Taras Holovko
Or having fun
Mar 01, 2016 11:30pm
Taras Holovko
Yes but would you rather spend your weekends and free time reading about art history
Mar 01, 2016 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
None of those are really too bad except bio
Mar 01, 2016 11:29pm
Taras Holovko
same for you
Mar 01, 2016 11:29pm
Taras Holovko
So that means Java, gov, bio, physics all require studying
Mar 01, 2016 11:29pm
Taras Holovko
Because this now means I have to get 5 on everything
Mar 01, 2016 11:28pm
Kevin Stephen
Keerthana wanted to take art w me as well
Mar 01, 2016 11:28pm
Kevin Stephen
Hm
Mar 01, 2016 11:28pm
Taras Holovko
And enjoy senior year
Mar 01, 2016 11:28pm
Taras Holovko
To diminish workload
Mar 01, 2016 11:28pm
Taras Holovko
Or should we just scrap art
Mar 01, 2016 11:28pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah not an issue
Mar 01, 2016 11:27pm
Taras Holovko
And I need a 5 on gov
Mar 01, 2016 11:27pm
Taras Holovko
Alright. That also means you need a 5 on Spanish
Mar 01, 2016 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Only half the course left
Mar 01, 2016 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
I think it's worth a go
Mar 01, 2016 11:27pm
Taras Holovko
But let's decide for art history now then
Mar 01, 2016 11:27pm
Taras Holovko
yeah I mean it would be 5 for me, 6 for you then
Mar 01, 2016 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
What 6 were you referring to then
Mar 01, 2016 11:27pm
Taras Holovko
Lot of memorization
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
Is it worth it
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
Idk about art history
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
Comp gov
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
Art history
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
The five from my classes
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
And we both get it
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
And let's just make sure we don't get any 4s
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
So take those 6 and compgov
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
Ok
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
I would hope it doesn't disqualify you
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
No they only count the highest score I checked
Mar 01, 2016 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
I don't know how that factors in
Mar 01, 2016 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
Your score average is slightly lower because of stat I think
Mar 01, 2016 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
There's a good chance we may both win the award
Mar 01, 2016 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
If we take the same number of exams
Mar 01, 2016 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
if you want, be my guest
Mar 01, 2016 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
Just saying
Mar 01, 2016 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
Waste of money and time
Mar 01, 2016 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
Idk
Mar 01, 2016 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
Physics 1 and 2 or no
Mar 01, 2016 11:24pm
Taras Holovko
And I'm perfectly satisfied with that
Mar 01, 2016 11:24pm
Taras Holovko
The rest I don't care
Mar 01, 2016 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
It's a lot but it's not hard
Mar 01, 2016 11:24pm
Taras Holovko
I'm going to focus on 3 exams: bio, lit, art
Mar 01, 2016 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
Art isn't too bad actually
Mar 01, 2016 11:24pm
Taras Holovko
I don't want to spend my spring slaving over things I don't care about
Mar 01, 2016 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
E&M is ridiculously difficult I'm 1/3 way through and understand very little
Mar 01, 2016 11:23pm
Taras Holovko
I have absolutely no interest in physics
Mar 01, 2016 11:23pm
Taras Holovko
And art also gives me some value beyond just the score--culture, etc
Mar 01, 2016 11:23pm
Taras Holovko
Physics is conceptual. Art is not
Mar 01, 2016 11:23pm
Taras Holovko
But I imagine it is much easier and cleaner than E&M
Mar 01, 2016 11:22pm
Taras Holovko
Art history will bring from 7.5 to 8.5, so part of it goes to waste
Mar 01, 2016 11:22pm
Taras Holovko
Will bring me from 7.5 credits to 8
Mar 01, 2016 11:22pm
Taras Holovko
Way too painful
Mar 01, 2016 11:22pm
Taras Holovko
Way too long
Mar 01, 2016 11:22pm
Taras Holovko
To learn
Mar 01, 2016 11:22pm
Taras Holovko
It's hell
Mar 01, 2016 11:22pm
Kevin Stephen
What about E&M
Mar 01, 2016 11:21pm
Taras Holovko
I was unsure about anything else. Euro and Spanish literature both would have given me 1 credit at Harvard, which is why they were on my list--not because I wanted to take all of them behind your back. I don't have the energy for that and I want to recover after years of work.
Mar 01, 2016 11:21pm
Taras Holovko
And all of this I decided tonight
Mar 01, 2016 11:20pm
Taras Holovko
I dont know if I want to do art history though
Mar 01, 2016 11:18pm
Taras Holovko
Art history will bring that to 3.5
Mar 01, 2016 11:18pm
Taras Holovko
Bio, lit, phys c M will give me 2.5 credits
Mar 01, 2016 11:18pm
Taras Holovko
I have no credit from compsci or gov so i don't care about either
Mar 01, 2016 11:17pm
Taras Holovko
And possibly art history because I am interested in it and I want to max out my credits at Harvard
Mar 01, 2016 11:17pm
Taras Holovko
Not including E&M
Mar 01, 2016 11:17pm
Taras Holovko
I'm going to take the 5 APs from our classes
Mar 01, 2016 11:17pm
Taras Holovko
With ulterior motives on both of our parts
Mar 01, 2016 11:14pm
Taras Holovko
This is just a mess and not worth it
Mar 01, 2016 11:14pm
Taras Holovko
Beneath me also
Mar 01, 2016 11:14pm
Taras Holovko
yeah
Mar 01, 2016 11:13pm
Kevin Stephen
it is unlike me and beneath both of us
Mar 01, 2016 11:12pm
Kevin Stephen
i apologize for getting angry
Mar 01, 2016 11:12pm
Kevin Stephen
Alright
Mar 01, 2016 11:12pm
Taras Holovko
But I haven't decided
Mar 01, 2016 11:09pm
Taras Holovko
I decided it wasn't worth wasting my time on this hullshit
Mar 01, 2016 11:09pm
Taras Holovko
Lol why
Mar 01, 2016 11:09pm
Kevin Stephen
then you can look at the text messages i sent my mom today to cancel music theory
Mar 01, 2016 11:09pm
Kevin Stephen
and if you're interested in which exams i'm taking
Mar 01, 2016 11:08pm
Kevin Stephen
that's reasonable
Mar 01, 2016 11:08pm
Kevin Stephen
that's not stupid
Mar 01, 2016 11:08pm
Kevin Stephen
i want to compete with you fairly
Mar 01, 2016 11:08pm
Kevin Stephen
i don't want to beat you
Mar 01, 2016 11:08pm
Taras Holovko
And childish
Mar 01, 2016 11:07pm
Taras Holovko
This is stupid
Mar 01, 2016 11:07pm
Taras Holovko
Other than to beat me apparently
Mar 01, 2016 11:07pm
Taras Holovko
So I don't know what you want from me
Mar 01, 2016 11:07pm
Kevin Stephen
good
Mar 01, 2016 11:04pm
Taras Holovko
I am still unsure
Mar 01, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
Then I was unsure
Mar 01, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
Was February 17
Mar 01, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
Last time you asked me
Mar 01, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
Still have not confirmed with sister Anne
Mar 01, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
Still have not given money
Mar 01, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
I did not give money
Mar 01, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
I put names down for everything
Mar 01, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
I was unsure
Mar 01, 2016 11:02pm
Kevin Stephen
and you think i didn't know you would do euro? it's why i told you which ones i was taking
Mar 01, 2016 11:02pm
Taras Holovko
For something this dumb
Mar 01, 2016 11:02pm
Taras Holovko
Because I lack knowledge about music
Mar 01, 2016 11:02pm
Taras Holovko
Knowing you would take advantage of music theory
Mar 01, 2016 11:02pm
Taras Holovko
Like you know how that felt lol
Mar 01, 2016 11:01pm
Taras Holovko
For something you didn't care about
Mar 01, 2016 11:01pm
Taras Holovko
For what
Mar 01, 2016 11:01pm
Taras Holovko
Your personal motive was to cultivate a desire to beat him just once?
Mar 01, 2016 11:01pm
Kevin Stephen
there's no point arguing with you is like arguing with a brick wall
Mar 01, 2016 11:01pm
Kevin Stephen
i explained to you my personal motives.
Mar 01, 2016 11:01pm
Taras Holovko
And now you attack me for all of this
Mar 01, 2016 11:00pm
Taras Holovko
I was just unsure
Mar 01, 2016 11:00pm
Taras Holovko
I wasn't even dishonest
Mar 01, 2016 10:59pm
Taras Holovko
When your personal motives were just as bad
Mar 01, 2016 10:59pm
Taras Holovko
You keep attacking me for honesty
Mar 01, 2016 10:59pm
Taras Holovko
the way we've done everything for 4 years?
Mar 01, 2016 10:59pm
Kevin Stephen
alright whatever taras
Mar 01, 2016 10:59pm
Kevin Stephen
and you equate the way we've done everything for 4 years to "sanctimonious bullshit"
Mar 01, 2016 10:59pm
Taras Holovko
I didn't tell anyone anything because I didn't know
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
I am not
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
I was not certain
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
I AM NOT
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
Or euro
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
Or Spanish lit
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
If I am taking art history
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
Ask me again
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
confronting you less than 24 hours afterwards
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
Kevin
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
that's my ulterior motives
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
ulterior motives = tell you the same day right
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
Stop giving me your sanctimonious bullshit about honesty
Mar 01, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
You deliberately went out of your way to extract information with ulterior Motives
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
tell me that honestly
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
tell me you wouldn't feel betrayed
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Taras Holovko
The grapevine
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
and i find out today from the grapevine
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Taras Holovko
For forms
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
for forms and money
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
the deadline was last week dude
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Taras Holovko
I said "idk probably the same ones as before"
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
I can understand english
Mar 01, 2016 10:57pm
Taras Holovko
Do you not get that
Mar 01, 2016 10:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Ok
Mar 01, 2016 10:56pm
Taras Holovko
And was not until today
Mar 01, 2016 10:56pm
Taras Holovko
I was not sure
Mar 01, 2016 10:56pm
Taras Holovko
You asked me
Mar 01, 2016 10:56pm
Taras Holovko
Honest way
Mar 01, 2016 10:56pm
Kevin Stephen
like you've always done
Mar 01, 2016 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
and you go about it in the most honest way you can
Mar 01, 2016 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
perhaps then you'll cultivate a desire to beat him just once
Mar 01, 2016 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
for four years
Mar 01, 2016 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
imagine having this happen over and over again
Mar 01, 2016 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
walking with your friend to countless people who recognize him but not you
Mar 01, 2016 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
being introduced as the salutatorian by your principal to visiting students
Mar 01, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
and he says "screw you this is school policy you're #2"
Mar 01, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
having a meeting with your dean in the middle of summer
Mar 01, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
working just as hard as them
Mar 01, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
having the same grades as someone for 4 years
Mar 01, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
imagine
Mar 01, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
its insulting to say i want to win for once?
Mar 01, 2016 10:54pm
Taras Holovko
And that pissed me off because friends don't act like that
Mar 01, 2016 10:52pm
Taras Holovko
you just wanted to beat me for the sake of just that
Mar 01, 2016 10:52pm
Taras Holovko
always uncertain of what I would take
Mar 01, 2016 10:52pm
Taras Holovko
And I was leaning towards whatever I had been doing
Mar 01, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
I didn't know whether it was worth it to do so many
Mar 01, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
Always uncertainty
Mar 01, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
Not dishonesty
Mar 01, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
This was my response to you.
Mar 01, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
Taras sent a photo.

Mar 01, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
You have no idea how insulting this is
Mar 01, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
Taras sent a photo.

Mar 01, 2016 10:51pm
Kevin Stephen
understand that if i wasn't your friend there's literally no reason i would've divulged every exam i was taking
Mar 01, 2016 10:48pm
Taras Holovko
Lol not like you ever acted like one
Mar 01, 2016 10:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Try someone more gullible next time
Mar 01, 2016 10:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Find yourself another sucker to be your friend dude
Mar 01, 2016 10:41pm
Taras Holovko
Taras: 󰀀

Mar 01, 2016 10:41pm
Kevin Stephen
not me
Mar 01, 2016 10:41pm
Kevin Stephen
I don't lie
Mar 01, 2016 10:41pm
Taras Holovko
Don't give me that
Mar 01, 2016 10:41pm
Taras Holovko
And you still don't
Mar 01, 2016 10:41pm
Taras Holovko
you never cared
Mar 01, 2016 10:41pm
Kevin Stephen
there is no reason in hell that i would ever vie for an award i don't care about
Mar 01, 2016 10:40pm
Taras Holovko
Alright dude
That's not the way you presented it to me
Mar 01, 2016 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
asked casey and david fan who said the same
Mar 01, 2016 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
she said yeah it may be a good idea
Mar 01, 2016 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
i asked keerthana
Mar 01, 2016 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
and they said yeah ok go for it
Mar 01, 2016 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
who originally told me not to do it
Mar 01, 2016 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
after i asked my parents
Mar 01, 2016 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
i decided to pursue state ap scholar
Mar 01, 2016 10:39pm
Taras Holovko
that's not friendship either no matter how you defend it as "competition"
Mar 01, 2016 10:38pm
Taras Holovko
something you openly disavowed, just for the sake of coming out on top
Mar 01, 2016 10:38pm
Taras Holovko
absurd
Mar 01, 2016 10:37pm
Taras Holovko
and what i perceive as even worse
Mar 01, 2016 10:37pm
Taras Holovko
because that's what you feel a need for
Mar 01, 2016 10:37pm
Taras Holovko
i could have said just as easily that it could be better spent trying to one-up each other
Mar 01, 2016 10:37pm
Taras Holovko
i have no intention of doing anything behind your back
Mar 01, 2016 10:36pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah it could be better spent doing things behind each other's backs
Mar 01, 2016 10:36pm
Taras Holovko
this time spent arguing
Mar 01, 2016 10:36pm
Taras Holovko
but this isn't worth it
Mar 01, 2016 10:36pm
Taras Holovko
i can argue that all you wanted to do was beat me
Mar 01, 2016 10:36pm
Kevin Stephen
and that by breaking your trust you willingly decided i wasn't worth your time as a friend
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Taras Holovko
you can argue i was dishonest
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
do you not understand that that talking point is totally irrelevant to the idea of trust
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Taras Holovko
we can argue about this forever
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Taras Holovko
look
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Taras Holovko
you said that countless times
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Taras Holovko
you never cared about the award
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
there's really not much of a difference
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
i have 13
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
nikhil had 12
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Taras Holovko
and you know it
Mar 01, 2016 10:35pm
Taras Holovko
oh cmon that's a load of bullshit
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
you don't
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
you know how? that there's no one else who has 14 5s who's trying to be state ap scholar
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
and you know this how?
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
an absolute need
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
and you felt a need
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
this was just you and me
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
absolutely no one else matters
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
and this
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
in the context of you and me
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
no
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
yes only you matter
Mar 01, 2016 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
no one else really matters
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Taras Holovko
ok
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
ask anyone besides yourself
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
i treat you far better than you treat me
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Taras Holovko
me
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Taras Holovko
the way you treat
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
this is why i told you the same day that i decided
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Taras Holovko
lol i can't even call you a friend
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
and they don't do things behind each other's backs
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
no matter what the circumstances
Mar 01, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
are honest to each other
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Kevin Stephen
friends
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Taras Holovko
i know that's what friends do for each other
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Taras Holovko
then that's great
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Taras Holovko
if that's all you wanted
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Kevin Stephen
you really don't
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Kevin Stephen
you really don't get it dude
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Taras Holovko
alright kevin
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Kevin Stephen
and so you think that the desire to beat you in something disqualifies me from being a friend
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Taras Holovko
you think that's any better form of a friendship?
Mar 01, 2016 10:32pm
Taras Holovko
you acknowledged it was useless
Mar 01, 2016 10:31pm
Taras Holovko
and you said that
Mar 01, 2016 10:31pm
Taras Holovko
it was about beating me
Mar 01, 2016 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
and yes you know for a fact that my mind did not change in the month between saying that and deciding to take 3 more exams
Mar 01, 2016 10:31pm
Taras Holovko
dude it wasn't about the award for you
Mar 01, 2016 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
and discover my motives for doing all these things
Mar 01, 2016 10:31pm
Taras Holovko
you straight up said this
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Kevin Stephen
because obviously you can get in my head
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
you said this
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
you didn't even care
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Kevin Stephen
and you know this because ....?
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
like
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
me
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
you're trying to essentially prove yourself better to just one person
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
you're not doing that
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
"competing for the same award"
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
i decided ultimately it wasn't
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
it's not worth it
Mar 01, 2016 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
never mind
Mar 01, 2016 10:29pm
Kevin Stephen
So you're telling me that competing for the same award disqualifies me from being your friend
Mar 01, 2016 10:29pm
Taras Holovko
in something you don't even care about
Mar 01, 2016 10:29pm
Taras Holovko
is just to win over me
Mar 01, 2016 10:29pm
Taras Holovko
when all you desire
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Taras Holovko
how can you call yourself a friend
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Taras Holovko
competition
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Kevin Stephen
there's a difference
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Kevin Stephen
and honesty
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Kevin Stephen
competition
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm not sure you understand the concepts of
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Kevin Stephen
i told you every single one of them
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Kevin Stephen
because when you asked
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Kevin Stephen
The reasons why I wanted the award don't classify it as scheming dude
Mar 01, 2016 10:28pm
Taras Holovko
But guess what I decided it wasn't worth it
Mar 01, 2016 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
And yeah I considered taking a bunch of bullshit exams
Mar 01, 2016 10:22pm
Taras Holovko
A means of you trying to tell me in my face that you're better than me
Mar 01, 2016 10:22pm
Taras Holovko
It's like
Mar 01, 2016 10:22pm
Taras Holovko
Me and you
Mar 01, 2016 10:22pm
Taras Holovko
Only two people ever would
Mar 01, 2016 10:22pm
Taras Holovko
This isn't even something anyone would recognize
Mar 01, 2016 10:22pm
Taras Holovko
That's absurd
Mar 01, 2016 10:21pm
Taras Holovko
And suddenly you decided you needed to chalk up a win over me -- not because you saw value in it like I had, but simply because it was over me
Mar 01, 2016 10:20pm
Taras Holovko
Absolutely laughed at my intentions
Mar 01, 2016 10:20pm
Taras Holovko
You laughed at this in the fall
Mar 01, 2016 10:20pm
Taras Holovko
You'retelling me you're not scheming? For trying to win something that you called "absolutely useless" just because it was OVER me
Mar 01, 2016 10:20pm
Kevin Stephen
well i'm not that naive anymore dude
Mar 01, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
and if you really expect me to believe that you were gonna tell me eventually
Mar 01, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
and that was honesty
Mar 01, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
this is about 1 thing that i expected from you and that i gave to you
Mar 01, 2016 10:19pm
Taras Holovko
I didn't know that was enough of a driving force for you to study that much bullshit
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
Here's your chance
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
that's not even what this is about
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
If you still want to win over me, then fine
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
You've won in every way possible
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
it's a reasonable desire to want the W for once
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
You're a Coke scholar
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
You're going to the #1 university in the country
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
Is it that bad
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Taras Holovko
Like what is this
Mar 01, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
after being called 2nd place my whole high school career
Mar 01, 2016 10:17pm
Kevin Stephen
after being relegated to salutatorian for taking a different language
Mar 01, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
To beat me
Mar 01, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
To want to win? What does that mean
Mar 01, 2016 10:17pm
Kevin Stephen
and it's not reasonable to want to win for once?
Mar 01, 2016 10:17pm
Taras Holovko
That's what I was planning to do
Mar 01, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
I was planning to drop them
Mar 01, 2016 10:16pm
Kevin Stephen
maybe two weeks
Mar 01, 2016 10:16pm
Kevin Stephen
perhaps a week after the deadline
Mar 01, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
like what does that even mean
Mar 01, 2016 10:16pm
Kevin Stephen
right so you were planning to tell me
Mar 01, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
You roast me for going after some pointless award
And then you tell me you want it too because you want to be first for once
Mar 01, 2016 10:16pm
Taras Holovko
Because I was reasoning which were worth it
And I decided none of them were
Mar 01, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
And I didn't
Mar 01, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
I told you I didn't know
Mar 01, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
I decided that
Mar 01, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
I'm 
Not
Interested
In
It
Mar 01, 2016 10:15pm
Taras Holovko
Lol you still don't get it do you
Mar 01, 2016 10:14pm
Kevin Stephen
because in those 17 years i've never met someone as scheming as you just showed you are
Mar 01, 2016 10:14pm
Kevin Stephen
namely for snapping me out of 17 years of naivete
Mar 01, 2016 10:13pm
Taras Holovko
Not until about an hour ago
Mar 01, 2016 10:13pm
Kevin Stephen
You know dude i have a lot to thank you for
Mar 01, 2016 10:13pm
Taras Holovko
And I didn't
Mar 01, 2016 10:13pm
Taras Holovko
I said I didn't know what I was taking
Mar 01, 2016 10:13pm
Taras Holovko
Then go for it -- it's yours
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Kevin Stephen
I still do want the award
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Taras Holovko
What the hell does that mean?
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Kevin Stephen
No
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Taras Holovko
You wanted to "be first for once"
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Taras Holovko
You didn't want state ap scholar
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Taras Holovko
You didn't want the award Kevin
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Kevin Stephen
This is ridiculous
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Kevin Stephen
You're incredibly petty
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Kevin Stephen
After breaking the honesty that we've held with each other for four years
Mar 01, 2016 10:12pm
Kevin Stephen
you're really going to bring up the algebra final right now
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Taras Holovko
I'm beyond it
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Taras Holovko
Whatever
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Taras Holovko
Just the way you even address me
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Taras Holovko
Always
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Taras Holovko
things like that
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Kevin Stephen
I got you back innumerable times for the algebra final
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Taras Holovko
You like resist
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Taras Holovko
And when I ask you for help with a problem online or something
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Taras Holovko
I straight up gave you the linear algebra final
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Taras Holovko
Lol you treat me like a stranger dude
Mar 01, 2016 10:11pm
Kevin Stephen
so you have an issue because i don't say hello to you in the morning
Mar 01, 2016 10:10pm
Taras Holovko
I told you--I was planning to do what I had been earlier. I listed everything while I was still considering it, and I was planning to drop, which I will.
Study what you want
Mar 01, 2016 10:06pm
Taras Holovko
And then you put on some false notion that you're my friend
Mar 01, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
half of the day
Mar 01, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
You ignore me
Mar 01, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
In the morning
Mar 01, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
Don't even fucking say hello to me
Mar 01, 2016 10:03pm
Taras Holovko
You straight up
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
dude
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Kevin Stephen
this is so typical of you
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
What
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
Do why you want
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
I decided after school
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
I'm dropping all of them
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
I never made a definitive decision
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
That I wanted to consider more
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
I decided later
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Kevin Stephen
"the same ones that i was planning to"
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
And potentially art history
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
That I am taking what I was
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Taras Holovko
I told you
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm guessing you forgot that convenient detail
Mar 01, 2016 10:02pm
Kevin Stephen
and had to find out from her that you lied to me
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
right after i walked into Sr Anne's office
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah dude
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
I'm guessing you don't remember that
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
You straight up ignore me
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
When I see you in the morning
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
one day you will as well
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
The way you ruin a friendship is by not saying hello
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
i get it
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
oh no taras
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
lol you don't get it
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Kevin Stephen
For future reference this is how you ruin a friendship
Mar 01, 2016 10:01pm
Taras Holovko
While I was contemplating
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Taras Holovko
I put the names down
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Taras Holovko
Do what you want
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Taras Holovko
I'm dropping half of them
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Kevin Stephen
you had to have the money in by yesterday
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Taras Holovko
Not bullshit
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Kevin Stephen
bulshit
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Taras Holovko
What I was taking
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Taras Holovko
I was not sure
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Kevin Stephen
every single one of them
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Kevin Stephen
i told you
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Kevin Stephen
and when you asked which exams i was taking
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Kevin Stephen
4 years we've been honest with each other
Mar 01, 2016 10:00pm
Kevin Stephen
i don't care which exams either of us take
Mar 01, 2016 9:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Fuck you Taras
Mar 01, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
If you want to win for once, it's all yours
Mar 01, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
Go ahead and do it
Mar 01, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
I don't give a damn anymore
Mar 01, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
What
Mar 01, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
You know why
Mar 01, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
And because now you feel obligated to take more
Mar 01, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
Is it because I didn't tell you what APs I'm taking?
Mar 01, 2016 9:59pm
Taras Holovko
Please enlighten me
Mar 01, 2016 9:53pm
Taras Holovko
Why am I an asshole
Mar 01, 2016 9:50pm
Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko
He probably has no idea what he's talking about

Taras Holovko
Just based on views

Taras Holovko

it's pretty tough
Feb 07, 2016 8:37pm
Taras Holovko

Feb 07, 2016 8:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Watching the game
Feb 07, 2016 8:37pm
Kevin Stephen

Feb 07, 2016 8:37pm
Taras Holovko
hey have you done gubernat yet
Feb 07, 2016 8:36pm
Kevin Stephen
I already asked Sarika to talk to him bc she probably gets through to him more than we do
Feb 06, 2016 10:56pm
Kevin Stephen
It's our responsibility to do so
Feb 06, 2016 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Anyways yes for sure
Feb 06, 2016 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Right because it's the other way around
Feb 06, 2016 10:55pm
Taras Holovko
I never perceived it as such
Feb 06, 2016 10:55pm
Taras Holovko
Hm maybe
Feb 06, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Just my honest opinion
Feb 06, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Things like when Sean makes fun of me for not having sex with Brittany are much more judgmental than anything that I say
Feb 06, 2016 10:54pm
Taras Holovko
I think we need to talk to Carson
Feb 06, 2016 10:54pm
Taras Holovko
But that being said
Feb 06, 2016 10:54pm
Taras Holovko
I just kinda wanted to let you know of the vibe
Feb 06, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
I think
Feb 06, 2016 10:54pm
Taras Holovko
Bc I've been where you've been so
Feb 06, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
I don't care honestly
Feb 06, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
idk I was talking to the others
Feb 06, 2016 10:51pm
Kevin Stephen
Is it "they" or you that feels I'm an overbearing influence?
Feb 06, 2016 10:51pm
Taras Holovko
Ik what you mean
Feb 06, 2016 10:50pm
Taras Holovko
lol yeah I feel
Feb 06, 2016 10:50pm
Kevin Stephen
One of the few things I've said about alcohol in that chat is "why are you going to Sean's house just to get drunk -- there's not even a party"
Feb 06, 2016 10:50pm
Kevin Stephen
I feel like I speak out relatively little
Feb 06, 2016 10:49pm
Taras Holovko
Idk lol
Feb 06, 2016 10:48pm
Taras Holovko
Like talking about alcohol and stuff
Feb 06, 2016 10:48pm
Taras Holovko
But they feel as though you're a bit of an overbearing influence
Feb 06, 2016 10:47pm
Taras Holovko
I agree
Feb 06, 2016 10:47pm
Kevin Stephen
You can't conflate the two
Feb 06, 2016 10:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Saying something is a bad idea doesn't equate to judging a person for doing it
Feb 06, 2016 10:47pm
Taras Holovko
alcohol / weed
Feb 06, 2016 10:46pm

Taras Holovko

Feb 06, 2016 10:44pm
Taras Holovko
I agree
Feb 06, 2016 10:43pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm concerned for his health
Feb 06, 2016 10:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Bro this stuff is legit dangerous
Feb 06, 2016 10:43pm
Taras Holovko
But are concerned too often haha

Taras Holovko

Feb 06, 2016 10:43pm
Kevin Stephen
You guys continually condone whatever he does
Feb 06, 2016 10:43pm
Kevin Stephen

Feb 05, 2016 12:12pm
Taras Holovko
It's fine
Feb 04, 2016 11:05pm
Taras Holovko
I'm not a fan
Feb 04, 2016 11:05pm
Taras Holovko
I don't like being restricted in writing
Feb 04, 2016 11:05pm
Kevin Stephen
undoubtedly one of the best classes at our school
Feb 04, 2016 11:05pm
Taras Holovko
lol Wait til you get to pton
Feb 04, 2016 11:05pm
Kevin Stephen
but you can't discredit the quality of her class because she's a nazi on grammar and word choice
Feb 04, 2016 11:04pm
Kevin Stephen
she's a high school english teacher lol i'm pretty sure most of them are like that
Feb 04, 2016 11:04pm
Kevin Stephen
that's just her personal style
Feb 04, 2016 11:04pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah i mean she's always been restricting
Feb 04, 2016 11:04pm
Taras Holovko
I just don't like how she boxes me into corners
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
She has taught me careful diction tho
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
Lol*
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
And I agree p l
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
Said fuck you to her structure
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
Sirens
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Kevin Stephen
and to that extent our class does a good job
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
About beeswax
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
The one 9
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Kevin Stephen
it's just lit analysis
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Taras Holovko
Mm
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Kevin Stephen
there's never anything profound
Feb 04, 2016 11:03pm
Kevin Stephen
like look at any model essay from the AP site
Feb 04, 2016 11:02pm
Kevin Stephen
lit analysis is rlly supposed to be about the lit terms
Feb 04, 2016 11:02pm
Taras Holovko
Similar idea
Feb 04, 2016 11:02pm
Taras Holovko
Arguing a claim bro
Feb 04, 2016 11:02pm
Kevin Stephen
there's a significant difference between the two
Feb 04, 2016 11:02pm
Taras Holovko
Lol you're going to Princeton
Feb 04, 2016 11:02pm
Kevin Stephen
literary analysis isn't necessarily persuasive writing
Feb 04, 2016 11:02pm
Kevin Stephen
i think i know how to write persuasively far better than most kids
Feb 04, 2016 11:01pm
Kevin Stephen
most high school kids don't
Feb 04, 2016 11:01pm
Taras Holovko
Tell me how we learned to argue something in at joes lol
Feb 04, 2016 11:01pm
Kevin Stephen
tell me how mr powers, w/ all of our freedom on essays and the like, taught us well for the exam in the least
Feb 04, 2016 11:01pm
Kevin Stephen
sure that structure is why she has one of the best AP averages in this school
Feb 04, 2016 11:00pm
Taras Holovko
It's all contrived and simplistic
Feb 04, 2016 11:00pm
Taras Holovko
Conclusion
Feb 04, 2016 11:00pm
Kevin Stephen
lol it's not a creative writing class
Feb 04, 2016 11:00pm
Taras Holovko
Opening
Feb 04, 2016 11:00pm
Taras Holovko
Csea
Feb 04, 2016 11:00pm
Kevin Stephen
which legitimizes it
Feb 04, 2016 11:00pm
Kevin Stephen
it's based off the AP setup
Feb 04, 2016 11:00pm
Taras Holovko
Don't like fundamental set up of her essays
Feb 04, 2016 10:58pm
Taras Holovko
I don't like it
Feb 04, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
it's nice to not have to write too much
Feb 04, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah lol it's fine
Feb 04, 2016 10:57pm
Taras Holovko
Which this wasn't 2 pages and we didn't have a limit like this
Feb 04, 2016 10:55pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah it's fine
Feb 04, 2016 10:55pm
Taras Holovko
Rip
Feb 04, 2016 10:55pm

Feb 01, 2016 6:25am
Taras Holovko
if you want to continue i'm not opposed whatsoever
Jan 30, 2016 3:53pm
Taras Holovko
I never meant it as criticism
Jan 30, 2016 3:53pm
Taras Holovko
That's fine
Jan 30, 2016 3:53pm
Kevin Stephen
If you want to have a productive conversation regarding the company's future that's not the way to do it lol you know that
Jan 30, 2016 3:51pm
Kevin Stephen
All I'm saying is there's no need or place for you to criticize me for wanting to continue through college
Jan 30, 2016 3:51pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes
Jan 30, 2016 3:50pm
Taras Holovko
ok dude
Jan 30, 2016 3:50pm
Kevin Stephen
But I'm saying it as it is
Jan 30, 2016 3:45pm
Kevin Stephen
Haha I am chill
Jan 30, 2016 3:45pm
Taras Holovko
lol wtf chill dude
Jan 30, 2016 3:45pm
Kevin Stephen
You're leaving it

Kevin Stephen
It's our company
Jan 30, 2016 9:40am
Kevin Stephen

Jan 30, 2016 9:39am
Taras Holovko
Ultimately your decision and I can't change anything and I know that
Jan 30, 2016 9:09am
Taras Holovko
Since it's our company
Jan 30, 2016 9:09am
Taras Holovko
Well I think we need to talk
Jan 30, 2016 9:09am
Kevin Stephen
You wouldn't be trying to persuade me not to
Jan 30, 2016 8:29am
Kevin Stephen
I mean if you really respected my decision to continue
Jan 30, 2016 8:28am
Taras Holovko
I respect your decision to continue though
Jan 30, 2016 7:19am
Taras Holovko
We need to have a serious conversation about this
Jan 30, 2016 7:19am
Taras Holovko
No I'm not roasting you
Jan 30, 2016 7:19am
Kevin Stephen
You're paying a nominal sum for Harvard
I'm paying full tuition
Jan 29, 2016 11:55pm
Kevin Stephen
I don't have the luxury of dropping Olympian because tutoring is a "low-hanging fruit" and there are more exciting things to invest my time in
Jan 29, 2016 11:55pm
Kevin Stephen
It's quite frustrating
Jan 29, 2016 11:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Btw can you stop roasting me for wanting to continue tutoring in college
Jan 29, 2016 11:54pm
Kevin Stephen
but now that i consider it, you're probably right
Jan 29, 2016 10:14pm
Kevin Stephen
i just feel that she would tell me if it were true
Jan 29, 2016 10:14pm
Kevin Stephen
i dont dispute that
Jan 29, 2016 10:14pm
Kevin Stephen
of course
Jan 29, 2016 10:14pm
Taras Holovko
Or hook ups
Recall the summer
Jan 29, 2016 10:14pm
Taras Holovko
Kevin relationships are solely the business of whoever is in it
Jan 29, 2016 10:14pm
Kevin Stephen
its not taboo
Jan 29, 2016 10:13pm
Taras Holovko
Ok

Kevin Stephen

Jan 29, 2016 10:13pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen

Jan 28, 2016 6:38pm
Kevin Stephen
idk how much app formatting matters
Jan 28, 2016 6:38pm
Taras Holovko
Is a combination of fucking up app formatting and not applying to enough schools

Taras Holovko
Kids make during college apps

Jan 28, 2016 6:35pm
Taras Holovko

Jan 28, 2016 6:35pm
Taras Holovko
The curve will be adjusted accordingly
Jan 28, 2016 6:35pm
Taras Holovko
It doesn't really matter if it's dumbed down

Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen
None of that anymore

Jan 19, 2016 10:50pm

2:07 dude nice
Jan 16, 2016 8:07pm
Taras Holovko
but w/e
Jan 14, 2016 10:42pm
Taras Holovko
that's not how chi-squared is set up
Jan 14, 2016 10:42pm
Taras Holovko
so fuckin dumb
Jan 14, 2016 10:42pm
Kevin Stephen
It can go either way
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Kevin Stephen
So the differences are not significant
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Taras Holovko
ok that is contrary to the way a real chi squared works
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Like set up 9:3:3:1 then affirm null hyp
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Taras Holovko
ok
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Then we're good to go
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Taras Holovko
and then disproving
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Taras Holovko
shouldn't we be setting up as 1:1:1:1
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Chi square is if we prove the null hypothesis correct
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Kevin Stephen
No
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Wait
Jan 14, 2016 10:41pm
Taras Holovko
can u confirm?
Jan 14, 2016 10:40pm
Taras Holovko
ok whatever i don't care
Jan 14, 2016 10:39pm
Taras Holovko
chi squared is to disprove the lack of statistical difference
Jan 14, 2016 10:39pm
Taras Holovko
that makes no sense
Jan 14, 2016 10:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah i asked him this morning
Jan 14, 2016 10:38pm
Taras Holovko
he said to do 9:3:3:1?
Jan 14, 2016 10:38pm
Kevin Stephen
But I see what you're saying
Jan 14, 2016 10:38pm
Kevin Stephen
He told us to yeah
Jan 14, 2016 10:38pm
Taras Holovko
9:3:3:1
Jan 14, 2016 10:31pm
Taras Holovko

Jan 14, 2016 10:31pm
Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen
It is significant?
Jan 14, 2016 10:30pm

Kevin Stephen
Idk I haven't done it yet
Jan 14, 2016 10:29pm
Taras Holovko

Jan 14, 2016 10:29pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen
Yes
Jan 14, 2016 10:29pm

I wear a pair of suede bucks. They’re quirky, but here, people like that. Even during finals week: “Hey, nice shoes!”

With them, I’m unchained. They park under desks, loosely tied, open to learn about the universe. They hug my feet when I work for the Brown Daily Herald, the Swearer Institute, or an independent study. 

Here, they’re never heavy. My shoes harmonize to the steps of others. We’re passionate. We’re loud. We have the prestige of kings, but only here, we smile like children.

I wear a pair of suede bucks; they just happen to be the color Brown.

i was impressed until "Cornell Daily Sun"
Dec 28, 2015 3:48pm
Taras Holovko
LAST is the Pilot G-2 0.5mm retractable gel pen. Grasp its plastic hilt. Run its smooth, jet-black ink across a sheet of naked paper. Ooh. The edge of its ink is sharp. I’m lunging to blog about the presidential election or slashing out a screaming stanza of heartbreak. It never bleeds through the paper when clashing ideas, providing a beautiful validation of the soul. The G-2 is pure creation, making a final product that touches others intellectually and emotionally. My ideas, through my sword, flow like water: soft, nuanced, but eventually carving out canyons. 

The G-2’s ingenuity will be nurtured through a minor in creative writing. It will plunge into the Cornell Daily Sun, fusing my pride in a world-class institution with my love for journalism. It will take risks in the English department’s prize competitions, hoping to display its artistry.

Hi Professor,

I had a few questions regarding the third test for our class. 

What is the latest day that you will accept the proofs? Would next Tuesday 12/15 be acceptable?

Have you decided on which day the test will be? The reason I ask is that I have quite a busy week with school--and hope to prepare adequately and give myself enough time to study. 

Thanks for your time,

Taras Holovko
And he has faith in it
Dec 02, 2015 8:42pm
Taras Holovko
He says the process is accurate
Dec 02, 2015 8:42pm
Taras Holovko
Andrew gave me a full rundown
Dec 02, 2015 8:42pm
Kevin Stephen
guns can easily be bought illegally too
Dec 02, 2015 4:41pm
Kevin Stephen
we have to crack down on the black market of weapons somehow
Dec 02, 2015 4:41pm
Kevin Stephen
I agree -- but idk if that will help much
Dec 02, 2015 4:40pm
Taras Holovko
We need to tighten gun laws
Dec 02, 2015 4:19pm
Taras Holovko

Dec 02, 2015 4:16pm
Taras Holovko
Will be the most unimportant test of my whole life
Dec 02, 2015 4:16pm
Taras Holovko
That linear algebra test
Dec 02, 2015 4:16pm
Taras Holovko
I have a feeling
Dec 02, 2015 4:16pm
Kevin Stephen

Dec 02, 2015 4:11pm
Taras Holovko
Or will take you
Dec 02, 2015 4:08pm
Taras Holovko
They're probably either deliberating
Dec 02, 2015 4:08pm
Taras Holovko
Doubt that they ask kids who they ruled out for it
Dec 02, 2015 4:07pm
Taras Holovko
The financial aid email really might be a sign
Dec 02, 2015 4:07pm
Taras Holovko
Also now that you mention it
Dec 02, 2015 4:07pm
Taras Holovko
For me this reaffirms that the process is just
Dec 02, 2015 4:07pm
Taras Holovko
We'll be good
Dec 02, 2015 4:07pm
Taras Holovko
I really do think it's holistic

Taras Holovko
Essays were "creative and thoughtful"
Dec 02, 2015 4:02pm
Taras Holovko
No comments whatsoever on that
Dec 02, 2015 4:02pm
Taras Holovko
No
Dec 02, 2015 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen
Maybe because of his essay
Dec 02, 2015 4:01pm
Taras Holovko
They ranked him potential
Dec 02, 2015 4:01pm
Taras Holovko
From "unlikely, only if room, potential, high priority"
Dec 02, 2015 4:00pm
Taras Holovko
He was ranked
Dec 02, 2015 4:00pm
Taras Holovko
Otherwise he was v strong
Dec 02, 2015 4:00pm
Taras Holovko
1/3-1/2 as many APs
Dec 02, 2015 3:59pm
Taras Holovko
Scores slightly weaker than ours
Dec 02, 2015 3:59pm
Taras Holovko
He was 22nd in US for biology
Dec 02, 2015 3:59pm
Taras Holovko
No idea why he was deferred
Dec 02, 2015 3:59pm
Taras Holovko
He had a really strong app
Dec 02, 2015 3:59pm
Taras Holovko
Andrew got second highest
Dec 02, 2015 3:58pm
Taras Holovko
Interviews rated from average to top few

Taras Holovko
Too many NJSP applicants

Taras Holovko

Dec 02, 2015 3:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I hope they call Sauerman or Glen to ask about me
Dec 02, 2015 3:56pm
Taras Holovko
They are very familiar with scholars
Dec 02, 2015 3:56pm
Taras Holovko
Just like they take note of all of it
Dec 02, 2015 3:56pm
Taras Holovko
Everything
Dec 02, 2015 3:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Like what
Dec 02, 2015 3:55pm
Taras Holovko
It's basically everything you'd expect
Dec 02, 2015 3:55pm
Taras Holovko
They permit you to do that once you get in
Dec 02, 2015 3:55pm
Taras Holovko

Dec 01, 2015 10:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Airplanes is kind of cliche
Dec 01, 2015 10:42pm
Taras Holovko
Describe yourself in three words. 
First Word: Idealist
Second Word: Open-minded
Third Word: Outgoing
Favorite food: Pierogies. I'm glad LA has so much variety in culture (and food) that I'll be sure to find them.
Favorite fictional character:
Greatest invention of all time: The airplane. A means of going home to Ukraine (and to USC), a means of transcending societies.
What do you like to do for fun? Spray painting. It's a way to evade the stresses of life in composition. Very cathartic, very fun.
Role model: My grandfather. He spent his life in a coalmine so my mother and I would have a chance to get ahead.
Favorite book: The Grapes of Wrath, by Steinbeck. There's something so human in the Joads' journey to California.
Best movie of all time: Rocky III. I love to root for the underdog—and love to see him overcome and triumph even more.
Favorite musical performer/band or composer: J. Cole. Mixed race. Born in Germany, raised in America. He embodies diversity (and good vibes too).
Dream job: Founding and running an NGO with a distinct start-up culture.
Dec 01, 2015 10:15pm

Dec 01, 2015 10:14pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm

Dec 01, 2015 9:25pm
Taras Holovko
the country ally matrix used in country caucus
Dec 01, 2015 9:25pm
Taras Holovko
not country matrix
Dec 01, 2015 9:25pm
Kevin Stephen
that would double the length of the packet
Dec 01, 2015 9:25pm
Taras Holovko
to the folder
Dec 01, 2015 9:25pm
Taras Holovko
can we add the country matrix

Taras Holovko
Three words to describe me
Dec 01, 2015 9:22pm
Taras Holovko
a good contrast to the rest of my app
Dec 01, 2015 9:17pm
Taras Holovko

Dec 01, 2015 9:17pm
Kevin Stephen

Nov 30, 2015 6:25pm
Taras Holovko
Had he not written about being Asian
Nov 30, 2015 6:24pm
Taras Holovko
Think he would've been in
Nov 30, 2015 6:23pm
Kevin Stephen
definitely not
Nov 30, 2015 6:23pm
Taras Holovko
not a good essay topic IMO
Nov 30, 2015 6:22pm
Taras Holovko
probably qualified enough
Nov 30, 2015 6:22pm
Taras Holovko
so ?????
Nov 30, 2015 6:22pm
Taras Holovko
somehow he got WL HY
Nov 30, 2015 6:22pm

Kevin Stephen
lol yeah i remember
Nov 30, 2015 6:22pm
Taras Holovko
he wrote about being an asian
Nov 30, 2015 6:22pm
Kevin Stephen
?
Nov 30, 2015 6:22pm
Kevin Stephen
you think he shouldve gotten rejected
Nov 30, 2015 6:22pm
Taras Holovko
topic wise
Nov 30, 2015 6:21pm
Taras Holovko
his common app was really bad
Nov 30, 2015 6:21pm
Kevin Stephen
that's troubling
Nov 30, 2015 6:21pm
Kevin Stephen
damn these kids are stealing the middlesex spots
Nov 30, 2015 6:21pm
Taras Holovko
no idea how lidrew got deferred
Nov 30, 2015 6:21pm
Kevin Stephen
wb all those kids who got deferred last year
Nov 30, 2015 6:21pm
Taras Holovko
i don't know how princeton takes kids left and right like that
Nov 30, 2015 6:19pm
Taras Holovko
idk
Nov 30, 2015 6:18pm
Kevin Stephen
but ofc logic lol
Nov 30, 2015 6:18pm
Kevin Stephen
logically he should be getting in then
Nov 30, 2015 6:18pm
Kevin Stephen
hm okay
Nov 30, 2015 6:18pm
Taras Holovko
she again
Nov 30, 2015 6:18pm
Taras Holovko
no rushil is val
Nov 30, 2015 6:18pm
Kevin Stephen
oh wow is he val
Nov 30, 2015 6:18pm
Taras Holovko
2400 4.0 first gen asian
Nov 30, 2015 6:17pm

Nov 30, 2015 6:17pm
Taras Holovko
yeah
Nov 30, 2015 6:17pm
Kevin Stephen
wow
Nov 30, 2015 6:17pm
Kevin Stephen
to princeton
Nov 30, 2015 6:17pm
Taras Holovko
that's insane
Nov 30, 2015 6:17pm
Taras Holovko
ehs also will probably get a quest bridge kid in tomorrow
Nov 30, 2015 6:17pm
Taras Holovko
quite honetly
Nov 30, 2015 6:14pm
Taras Holovko
if addie is accepted and you are not, then princeton is not worth your time
Nov 30, 2015 6:14pm
Kevin Stephen
hm yeah that is unusual
Nov 30, 2015 6:14pm
Taras Holovko
all indian/asian
Nov 30, 2015 6:14pm
Taras Holovko
they'er not black
Nov 30, 2015 6:13pm
Kevin Stephen
lol @addie
Nov 30, 2015 6:13pm
Taras Holovko
better actiities
Nov 30, 2015 6:13pm
Taras Holovko
better grades
Nov 30, 2015 6:13pm
Taras Holovko
rushil has double the aps
Nov 30, 2015 6:13pm
Taras Holovko
like that's absurd
Nov 30, 2015 6:13pm
Taras Holovko
but i can't see that as being the sole cause
Nov 30, 2015 6:13pm
Taras Holovko
most likely i imagine
Nov 30, 2015 6:13pm
Kevin Stephen
maybe princeton looks really highly upon gov school/scholars
Nov 30, 2015 6:12pm
Taras Holovko
Compared to Rushil / you
Nov 30, 2015 6:12pm
Taras Holovko
Really shitty lol
Nov 30, 2015 6:12pm
Taras Holovko
2 leadership positions
Nov 30, 2015 6:12pm
Taras Holovko
Gov school kid had 7 activities
Nov 30, 2015 6:12pm
Taras Holovko
Doesn't make sense
Nov 30, 2015 6:12pm
Kevin Stephen
oh yeah that's reallly likely if they requested scores from the others
Nov 30, 2015 6:11pm
Taras Holovko
And is deciding between the other two
Nov 30, 2015 6:11pm
Taras Holovko
Rushil is worried that Princeton basically deferred him
Nov 30, 2015 6:11pm
Taras Holovko
Might be a toss up between all of them
Nov 30, 2015 6:11pm
Taras Holovko
And like
Nov 30, 2015 6:11pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah damn that's a lot
Nov 30, 2015 6:11pm
Taras Holovko
Really competitive year for them
Nov 30, 2015 6:10pm
Taras Holovko
Because 6 kids from ehs applied
Nov 30, 2015 6:10pm
Kevin Stephen
right right
Nov 30, 2015 6:10pm
Taras Holovko
That's why he's stressing like crazy
Nov 30, 2015 6:10pm
Taras Holovko
Princeton dude
Nov 30, 2015 6:10pm
Kevin Stephen
where'd he apply early?
Nov 30, 2015 6:10pm
Taras Holovko
Better grades
Nov 30, 2015 6:10pm
Taras Holovko

Nov 14, 2015 11:51pm
Taras Holovko

Nov 14, 2015 4:32pm

Nov 13, 2015 10:19pm

I think the migrant influx is easily correlatable to the attack

Taras Holovko
That's insane
Nov 13, 2015 10:16pm
Taras Holovko

Nov 08, 2015 1:18am
Kevin Stephen

Oct 31, 2015 4:42pm
Taras Holovko
I don't get your point
Oct 31, 2015 4:42pm
Kevin Stephen
It's good writing but I don't think an admissions counselor will have any idea what you're talking about
Oct 31, 2015 4:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Like the sentence about climate debt to solar cells
Oct 31, 2015 4:41pm
Taras Holovko
the way it is now?
Oct 31, 2015 4:41pm
Kevin Stephen
If I wasn't at scholars myself, I'd be like "huh?"
Oct 31, 2015 4:41pm
Kevin Stephen
That the way you phrase the details renders them less than understandable for someone not exposed to the program
Oct 31, 2015 4:41pm

four-walled classroom?
Oct 31, 2015 4:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Lol straight wording from mine
Oct 31, 2015 4:40pm
Taras Holovko
11 years studying on my own led me box subjects into complacent stereotypes—politics inhabiting one side of my brain, thermodynamics another.
The realities of climate change to which I was introduced at the interdisciplinary NJ Scholars Program—sinking of Tuvalu, Indonesian climate refugees, dissipation of Inupiat culture—would shatter that reductionist world, rendering me too helpless to do anything alone.
Only behind the harkness table—in discussion with twelve others—did everything shift.
Each voice imbued silence with ideas about Western climate debt, linking it to categorical imperatives; every thought about objectivism and solar cells sprang with living force, not one of them superfluous.
In those moments I found beauty in the smallest of ways: listening to others' words sparking life, injecting my thoughts into dialogue devoid of hope, every idea reminding me that our greatest action was to analyze, question, and think—together—to bridge the rift between what was and what could be.
Oct 31, 2015 4:40pm

im not using it lol
Oct 31, 2015 4:40pm

"My mind was a four-walled classroom"
Oct 31, 2015 4:39pm
Taras Holovko
The New Jersey Scholars Program was less an opportunity than a blessing in disguise.
Before then, I'd spent years studying subjects on my own; my mind was a four-walled classroom—I sat alone inside it.
The realities of climate change would shatter that world of four-walled classrooms—with its loss of Tuvalu, migration of Indonesians, dissipation of Inupiat culture—rendering me (and 38 others) too helpless to do anything about it.
But behind the harkness table, it didn’t seem to be so. 
Each voice imbued the silence with pulsing ideas about climate science, linking it to sociology and literature; every thought sprang with living force, not one of them superfluous.
In each of those moments I would find beauty in the smallest of ways: listening to others’ words bringing life into empty air, releasing my thoughts into conversations needing a spark, every idea reminding me that my greatest action is to pursue my passion with others, to release a flow of thoughts into what is otherwise bare.
In that flow of thoughts that would become actions, we could engage in the process of perceiving, questioning, imagining—together—to bridge the rift between what is and what can be.

Oct 31, 2015 11:50am

the idea of like mixing subjects?
Oct 31, 2015 11:50am
Kevin Stephen
haha i see some parts of my essay in there
Oct 31, 2015 11:50am
Taras Holovko
New Jersey Scholars was less an opportunity than a blessing in disguise: a 5-week examination of climate change that taught me that politics and physics didn’t have to be as separate as the classrooms enclosing them.


I'd spent 11 years studying subjects that were polarized, boxed into complacent stereotypes—international relations inhabited one side of my brain, thermodynamics another.

But NJ Scholars would shatter that worldview—climate change smeared the boundaries between humanities and science in the greatest of ways: in the legislative failure to foster sustainable energy, in our ethical deliberations on global warming.

So the end of the program wasn't as much a coda as a commencement: I’d entered a brave new world where politics didn't bar me from loving biology, where podiums allowed me to mesh advocacy and hypothesizing in activism, where I could engage in the process of analyzing, questioning, and thinking—across fields—to bridge the rift between what is and what can be.

Wielding a spray can is really less an act of carelessness than a way of thought.

I had dabbled in drawing for years, but the day I decided I’d had enough of paintbrush was more a commencement than a coda; graffiti was a form that held promise—that gave me the chance to create stark forms unlike anything I’d ever shaped, to cut loud stencils of Che and Jobs that boldly shouted of revolution, of unprecedented change.

Graffiti—even if on paper—wasn’t just art.

It was a genuine and soulful endearment of everything it embodied—all the sentiment and perception that made me whole. 

Each letter boldly slashed empty space with pulsing activity; every line sprang from an unseen living force, not one of them superfluous.

Through it I would find freedom in the smallest of ways: splashing color onto vacant canvas, imposing energy onto a paper yearning for life, each letter reminding me that my greatest action was to release passion to fill what had been bare.
Oct 29, 2015 7:05pm

Hey Taras,

Zack and I read over your 3 essays. Currently, none of the three are particularly inspiring, at least in their current forms. The main issue across your second and third essays is that they are too achievement-focused. The first essay has the opposite problem. 
The snowboarding essay, based on its execution, is not really the humanizing element that we're looking for here. The essay goes a little too far and ends up lacking direction -- questions I might ask are, "What is even the point of this essay? And why has he chosen to write this as his EC essay?" Although it is beautifully written, nothing really "happens" in this essay, so it's not effective from an admissions perspective.
NJ Scholars has more promise. The first paragraph is fantastic in drawing the reader in. However, the "What ifs?" come off as bragging, and the ultimate theme of achievement dehumanizes the essay. We already know that you are a great leader from your other essay -- can you make the focus something different?
The cross country theme had potential when you discussed it with me over the phone, but I think your execution currently leads the essay more towards achievement rather than camaraderie. If you want to rework this essay, make it more about the relationships than the outcome.
Kind regards,
Johan

The New Jersey Scholars Program was less an opportunity than a blessing in disguise: a 5-week interdisciplinary examination of climate change that taught 39 students to seek questions rather than answers. 

The end of the program wasn’t as much a coda for me as it was a commencement: a commencement to what if?

What if I reached out to the local chapter of 350.org?
What if we 39 could make use of our knowledge to address climate change as our own?
What if there was a way we could connect high schoolers to take action?

Weeks later found me in front of a room of activists, explaining why young people feared climate change, why we failed to do anything, and what I hoped to rally 38 others to do.

Climate change could be as interdisciplinary as it desired, but leaving knowledge unused would be injustice. For what was question or answer without action?

June through November:
Six months spent coaxing twenty-eight runners to drop a 5K rather than a Frisbee.

Not as much a coda to any cross-country career as a commencement to convincing: convincing the pack to pick up pace the Monday of a workout.

Or not to the Tuesday right after.

It was a paradox of needs and desires, with members from every strata of the high school food chain.

But all this was validated by the moment I—a seven-year veteran of dying in the last mile—saw four underclassmen slip by me on the final hill at the county meet.

It was vindicated by the moment Ryan O’Malley embraced me after race’s end to gush about the 49 seconds he’d dropped, making me too choked up in sweat and tears to reciprocate.

Losing to three sophomores and a junior is really less a burden than a blessing in disguise.

Oct 21, 2015 8:41pm
Taras Holovko
spend like 4 hours staring at that app daily lol
Oct 21, 2015 8:40pm
Kevin Stephen
at this point that may not be the most effective use of your time
Oct 21, 2015 8:40pm

Kevin Stephen
I may apply ea to Princeton then
Oct 21, 2015 4:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Oct 21, 2015 4:56pm
Taras Holovko
See if I can negotiate for aid if needed
Oct 21, 2015 4:55pm
Taras Holovko
If I get into Harvard early I think I might shoot apps to Stanford and Yale RD
Oct 21, 2015 4:54pm
Taras Holovko
Idk
Oct 21, 2015 4:54pm
Kevin Stephen
But tbh I think that's a myth
Oct 21, 2015 4:54pm
Taras Holovko
oh right
Oct 21, 2015 4:54pm
Kevin Stephen
If that's a thing
Oct 21, 2015 4:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Blacklisting?
Oct 21, 2015 4:54pm
Taras Holovko
TBH why not just apply to Princeton then?
Oct 21, 2015 4:53pm
Taras Holovko
Yea
Oct 21, 2015 4:53pm
Kevin Stephen
It's ok maybe I can rack up the ivy acceptances lolol
Oct 21, 2015 4:53pm
Taras Holovko
Harvard takes 400 early lol
Oct 21, 2015 4:53pm
Kevin Stephen
LOL
Oct 21, 2015 4:53pm
Taras Holovko
That sucks
Oct 21, 2015 4:52pm
Taras Holovko
Well
Oct 21, 2015 4:52pm
Kevin Stephen
M&T takes 15 kids from the northeast region
Oct 21, 2015 4:52pm
Kevin Stephen
Not even close
Oct 21, 2015 4:52pm
Taras Holovko
Ok now were equally likely to be screwed early good
Oct 21, 2015 4:51pm
Kevin Stephen
Considering I already have 5 essays written
Oct 21, 2015 4:50pm
Taras Holovko
Hm I guess
Oct 21, 2015 4:50pm
Kevin Stephen
But that's not that bad
Oct 21, 2015 4:50pm
Taras Holovko
If you don't get into M&T
Oct 21, 2015 4:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I'll have to do all the other apps
Oct 21, 2015 4:50pm
Kevin Stephen
It's not bad
Oct 21, 2015 4:49pm
Taras Holovko
Bc basically you're gonna have to do the rest of your apps
Oct 21, 2015 4:49pm
Taras Holovko
That's eh
Oct 21, 2015 4:49pm
Taras Holovko
Ok I see now
Oct 21, 2015 4:49pm
Taras Holovko
Oh I thought you could get into Wharton early non binding
Oct 21, 2015 4:49pm
Kevin Stephen
The way this works is i apply ED to M&T and if I'm rejected from M&T they consider me regular for Wharton
Oct 21, 2015 4:49pm
Kevin Stephen
No see I won't be applying early
Oct 21, 2015 4:48pm
Taras Holovko
I'm pretty confident
Oct 21, 2015 4:48pm
Taras Holovko
You'll get in early
Oct 21, 2015 4:48pm
Kevin Stephen
Hopefully anyway
Oct 21, 2015 4:48pm
Kevin Stephen
And I'll prob get into Wharton RD
Oct 21, 2015 4:48pm
Taras Holovko
Nice
Oct 21, 2015 4:48pm
Kevin Stephen
Exactly
Oct 21, 2015 4:48pm
Kevin Stephen
I can apply ED to M&T and non-binding to Wharton
Oct 21, 2015 4:48pm
Taras Holovko
And if you get into M&T it can't get much better anyway
Oct 21, 2015 4:47pm
Taras Holovko
So you can only build on that
Oct 21, 2015 4:47pm
Taras Holovko
You'll be sure to get into wharton
Oct 21, 2015 4:47pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah that's really good
Oct 21, 2015 4:47pm
Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko

Oct 14, 2015 3:08pm
Taras Holovko
Ugh I mean what're the chances I don't get in anywhere I actually want to go
Oct 14, 2015 3:07pm
Kevin Stephen
And I could go to Wharton for MBA
Oct 14, 2015 3:07pm
Taras Holovko
I'd take that over UNC
Oct 14, 2015 3:07pm
Taras Holovko
UVA is better
Oct 14, 2015 3:07pm
Kevin Stephen
And free? Not bad
Oct 14, 2015 3:07pm
Kevin Stephen
It's a good school
Oct 14, 2015 3:07pm
Kevin Stephen
I mean idk I wouldn't mind saying UVA
Oct 14, 2015 3:07pm
Taras Holovko
That hurts my ears
Oct 14, 2015 3:07pm
Taras Holovko
I don't want to spend the rest of my life telling people I went to UNC
Oct 14, 2015 3:07pm
Kevin Stephen
A lot
Oct 14, 2015 3:06pm
Taras Holovko
For these programs
Oct 14, 2015 3:06pm
Taras Holovko
If you and I ended up at UVA and UNC
Oct 14, 2015 3:06pm
Taras Holovko
How much would it suck
Oct 14, 2015 3:06pm
Taras Holovko
Ah
Oct 14, 2015 3:06pm
Kevin Stephen
The other is a generic question about leadership
Oct 14, 2015 3:00pm
Kevin Stephen
One of them is about my background in M&T
Oct 14, 2015 3:00pm
Taras Holovko
what's your specialized question
Oct 14, 2015 3:00pm
Kevin Stephen
Since I already discussed MUN app, scholars, philmont
Oct 14, 2015 3:00pm
Kevin Stephen
Not really sure what to talk about now for the penn leadership question
Oct 14, 2015 2:59pm
Taras Holovko
and those are relatively easy
Oct 14, 2015 2:59pm
Taras Holovko
besides that most schools have the short ones
Oct 14, 2015 2:59pm
Taras Holovko
some long stuff for uchicago, cornell, penn
Oct 14, 2015 2:59pm
Taras Holovko
nothing is really that bad
Oct 14, 2015 2:59pm
Taras Holovko

Oct 14, 2015 2:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah that too
Oct 14, 2015 2:59pm
Taras Holovko
i'll just put that I'm an eagle scout
Oct 14, 2015 2:59pm
Taras Holovko

Oct 14, 2015 2:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Talk about the backpacking trip you went on last year in New Mexico
Oct 14, 2015 2:56pm
Taras Holovko
i'll probably be like "we do all this cool shit in ukraine look at me'
Oct 14, 2015 2:56pm
Taras Holovko

Oct 14, 2015 2:56pm
Taras Holovko

Oct 14, 2015 2:56pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Oct 14, 2015 2:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Oh wow that's really cool
Oct 14, 2015 2:56pm
Taras Holovko
is dedicated to fitness and physical vigor
Oct 14, 2015 2:55pm
Taras Holovko

Oct 14, 2015 2:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Physical vigor lol what
Oct 14, 2015 2:55pm
Taras Holovko

Oct 14, 2015 2:55pm
Kevin Stephen
They're good
Oct 14, 2015 2:55pm
Taras Holovko
morehead cain is all about some physical vigor shit
Oct 14, 2015 2:55pm
Taras Holovko
Tell us about a time when an unfamiliar idea challenged your way of thinking (600 char)
I’d always imagined that how I improved the Model UN experience was for future rather than past—not to say that I disregarded the latter, it just dwindled next to the former. 

But as I sat in front of the Washington Monument with 37 other Youth Governors last June, in deep reflection about what we’d learned that week, I could think about little else but the nearly eighty-year legacy bestowed upon me, hundreds of thousands of servant leaders before me, and the notion that the past was really so much more than just four letters. Philosophers call it a paradigm shift; I call it mind-blowing.

Please describe any non-academic goals you have for this year (270 char)
I hope to (convince my parents to let me) hike in the wilderness for 10 days—alone. Once my track career ends, I’ll rock 26.2 miles on a canal path that extends from Edison to Pennsylvania. Neither goal is for training—but for the raw, untainted pureness of experience.
Oct 14, 2015 2:53pm
Taras Holovko

Oct 12, 2015 12:33am
Kevin Stephen
I know
Oct 12, 2015 12:31am
Taras Holovko
that makes no sense whatsoever
Oct 12, 2015 12:31am
Kevin Stephen
So if I'm not able to eke out a negotiation
Then I may have to break up with Brittany to go to Wharton
Oct 12, 2015 12:31am
Kevin Stephen
And I don't want to be the rat
Oct 12, 2015 12:30am
Kevin Stephen
It's all done
Oct 12, 2015 12:30am
Kevin Stephen
No need re: the app
Oct 12, 2015 12:30am
Taras Holovko
I'm going to talk to her
Oct 12, 2015 12:18am
Kevin Stephen
Totally dropped the ball after building the initial folders
Oct 12, 2015 12:17am
Kevin Stephen
Ellie missed the app call as well
Oct 12, 2015 12:17am
Taras Holovko
Ellie said she would do the work
Oct 12, 2015 12:16am
Taras Holovko
They changed a topic in sept
Oct 12, 2015 12:16am
Kevin Stephen
That was due like ten years ago
Oct 12, 2015 12:16am
Kevin Stephen
Are you serious
Oct 12, 2015 12:16am
Taras Holovko
Wtf I'm going to kill them
Oct 12, 2015 12:15am
Taras Holovko
like Ellie and Connor haven't finished their matrix
Oct 12, 2015 12:15am
Kevin Stephen
Damn and probably for good reason
Oct 12, 2015 12:12am
Kevin Stephen
Like heads up there will be other girls at college
Oct 12, 2015 12:12am
Taras Holovko
I went off on like 6 officers after Alex told me I didn't have control of the corps
Oct 12, 2015 12:11am
Taras Holovko
Agreed it is
Oct 12, 2015 12:10am
Kevin Stephen
this has gotten ridiculous
Oct 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
Exactly
Oct 12, 2015 12:09am
Taras Holovko
Wtf
Oct 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
Don't know
Oct 12, 2015 12:09am
Taras Holovko
Where is she going
Oct 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
They dont want me going to school near Brittany
Oct 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
Total bullshit reason
Oct 12, 2015 12:08am
Taras Holovko
Uh
Oct 12, 2015 12:08am
Kevin Stephen
Which sounds like a legit reason until I tell you that it doesn't mean financial options
Oct 12, 2015 12:08am
Taras Holovko
Understandable
Oct 12, 2015 12:08am
Kevin Stephen
They want options
Oct 12, 2015 12:06am
Taras Holovko
Why
Oct 12, 2015 12:06am
Kevin Stephen
Ugh 
my parents are making me reconsider Wharton ED
Oct 11, 2015 11:53pm
Kevin Stephen

Yeah
Oct 11, 2015 11:46pm
Kevin Stephen
and he's forgotten that there's a difference
Oct 11, 2015 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
i think alex is too used to talking to Mackensie consultants
Oct 11, 2015 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
i don't think any sec gen in recent history has done more than you to control the corps
Oct 11, 2015 11:38pm
Kevin Stephen
dude
Oct 11, 2015 11:38pm
Kevin Stephen
ugh
Oct 11, 2015 11:37pm
Taras Holovko
What have I been doing the past half year
Oct 11, 2015 11:37pm
Taras Holovko
"Make sure you make the most of this before it is gone"
Oct 11, 2015 11:37pm
Taras Holovko
What the hell does that mean
Oct 11, 2015 11:36pm
Taras Holovko
Taras sent a photo.

Oct 11, 2015 11:36pm
Kevin Stephen
damn i can only imagine running this whole corps
Oct 11, 2015 11:36pm
Taras Holovko
If I hear one more time that I don't have control over everyone
Oct 11, 2015 11:34pm

who's experienced it first-hand
Oct 06, 2015 8:35pm
Taras Holovko
but even more importantly, beneath its facade, it portrays me as someone who knows the struggles there
Oct 06, 2015 8:35pm
Taras Holovko
and that's such a great message
Oct 06, 2015 8:35pm
Taras Holovko
but in doing it myself i abandoned that attitude
Oct 06, 2015 8:35pm
Taras Holovko
and that mechanization and american machinery was the way to go
Oct 06, 2015 8:35pm
Taras Holovko
because i grew up thinking it was all dumb and worthelss
Oct 06, 2015 8:35pm
Taras Holovko
because
Oct 06, 2015 8:35pm
Taras Holovko
displaces
Oct 06, 2015 8:27pm
Taras Holovko
which is critical for admissions
Oct 06, 2015 8:27pm

Oct 05, 2015 11:30pm
Taras Holovko
more specific
Oct 05, 2015 11:30pm
Taras Holovko
less background and MUN work
Oct 05, 2015 11:30pm
Taras Holovko
just focus it more on a conflict
Oct 05, 2015 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
i think i'm on the right track
Oct 05, 2015 11:29pm
Kevin Stephen
lol no need to apologize
Oct 05, 2015 11:29pm
Taras Holovko
and im really tired of this BS

Taras Holovko

Oct 05, 2015 11:28pm
Taras Holovko

Oct 05, 2015 11:28pm
Kevin Stephen
lolol
Oct 05, 2015 11:28pm
Taras Holovko
can't mention high school without telling teh story of the rest of my life
Oct 05, 2015 11:28pm
Taras Holovko
can't mention the program without mentioning high school
Oct 05, 2015 11:28pm
Taras Holovko
that's the same logic as saying
Oct 05, 2015 11:28pm
Taras Holovko
that's what recs are for
Oct 05, 2015 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
can't mention the officership without mentioning the program
Oct 05, 2015 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
i can't mention the app without mentioning my time as officer
Oct 05, 2015 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
that's my only engineering experience
Oct 05, 2015 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
but i have to talk about the app
Oct 05, 2015 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
right i see that
Oct 05, 2015 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
to Penn
Oct 05, 2015 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
to the app
Oct 05, 2015 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
to yourself as an officer and your rise
Oct 05, 2015 11:26pm
Taras Holovko
as a whole
Oct 05, 2015 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
like you go from mun
Oct 05, 2015 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
not even that
Oct 05, 2015 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
no
Oct 05, 2015 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
so i have to pick either MUN or climate change you're saying
Oct 05, 2015 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
but gotta pick one
Oct 05, 2015 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
you can't talk about the whole mun experience
Oct 05, 2015 11:25pm
Taras Holovko
you cover everything
Oct 05, 2015 11:24pm
Taras Holovko
no like
Oct 05, 2015 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
but it seems disjoint ik
Oct 05, 2015 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
or that is the primary reason
Oct 05, 2015 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
the app we only built to decrease the footprint of conference
Oct 05, 2015 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
it is one thing
Oct 05, 2015 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
see that's the thing
Oct 05, 2015 11:23pm
Taras Holovko
you need to pick one thing to write about
Oct 05, 2015 11:23pm
Taras Holovko
from what i understand
Oct 05, 2015 11:23pm
Kevin Stephen
need to integrate the first and second parts more
Oct 05, 2015 11:23pm
Kevin Stephen
don't mind the writing but lmk what you think of the idea
Oct 05, 2015 11:23pm
Kevin Stephen
sort of drafted the one penn essay

Oct 05, 2015 9:50pm
Taras Holovko
Greatest essay concept

Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen

Oct 05, 2015 9:35pm
Kevin Stephen
in terms of essays we're looking good
Oct 05, 2015 9:34pm
Kevin Stephen
i think we'll be fine
Oct 05, 2015 9:34pm
Taras Holovko
What an understatement
Oct 05, 2015 9:34pm
Kevin Stephen
well that's all of our hopes haha
Oct 05, 2015 9:34pm
Taras Holovko
I hope this pays off and I get into Harvard

Oct 05, 2015 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
thanks thanks
Oct 05, 2015 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
yep i did
Oct 05, 2015 9:33pm
Taras Holovko
i recommend looking at the admissions hero tips for the essy
Oct 05, 2015 9:33pm
Taras Holovko
that's exactly what u should do
Oct 05, 2015 9:33pm
Taras Holovko
yes
Oct 05, 2015 9:32pm
Kevin Stephen
is it appropriate, in this kind of essay, to talk about my experience in business and engineering
Oct 05, 2015 9:27pm
Kevin Stephen
"Explain how you will use this program to explore your interest in business, engineering, and the intersection of the two. It is helpful to identify potential engineering and business paths available at Penn. (400-650 words)"
Oct 05, 2015 9:26pm
Taras Holovko
This is so hard lol
Oct 05, 2015 8:41pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah will do
Oct 05, 2015 8:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Show me what you come up with
Oct 05, 2015 8:40pm
Kevin Stephen
That's good
Oct 05, 2015 8:40pm
Taras Holovko
i think that's reflective of my worldview to some degree
Oct 05, 2015 8:32pm
Taras Holovko
but there's always some sort of prospect and optimism to be had
Oct 05, 2015 8:32pm
Taras Holovko
i realize the world certainly isn't perfect and that a lot of things are bad
Oct 05, 2015 8:31pm
Taras Holovko
how about this takeaway
Oct 05, 2015 8:31pm
Taras Holovko
question
Oct 05, 2015 8:31pm
Kevin Stephen
Lolol you're getting curved by all your point people
Oct 05, 2015 8:13pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm not a college consultant haha
Oct 05, 2015 8:08pm
Taras Holovko
ok anyway
Oct 05, 2015 8:08pm
Kevin Stephen
I don't see why not
Oct 05, 2015 8:08pm
Kevin Stephen
I mean
Oct 05, 2015 8:08pm
Taras Holovko
a really really good poem
Oct 05, 2015 8:08pm
Taras Holovko
like the supplement essay
Oct 05, 2015 8:08pm
Taras Holovko
no
Oct 05, 2015 8:08pm
Kevin Stephen
You mean like supplementary material?
Oct 05, 2015 8:07pm
Kevin Stephen
Lol what
Oct 05, 2015 8:07pm
Taras Holovko
what if i submit a poem for my yale supplement
Oct 05, 2015 8:07pm
Kevin Stephen
I'll send you as soon as I finish
Oct 05, 2015 8:05pm
Kevin Stephen
Half done with another iteration of CA as well as two of my Wharton supplements
Oct 05, 2015 8:05pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm writing like three essays at once haha
Oct 05, 2015 8:04pm
Taras Holovko
can i read
Oct 05, 2015 7:52pm
Taras Holovko
have u written anything new
Oct 05, 2015 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
hope
Oct 05, 2015 7:49pm
Kevin Stephen
that's a very general theme too
Oct 05, 2015 7:49pm
Kevin Stephen
ohh
Oct 05, 2015 7:49pm
Taras Holovko
like there's still some sort of prospect
Oct 05, 2015 7:32pm
Taras Holovko
even though everything blows
Oct 05, 2015 7:31pm
Taras Holovko
could be that
Oct 05, 2015 7:31pm
Taras Holovko
the message of the essay
Oct 05, 2015 7:31pm
Taras Holovko
no i mean like
Oct 05, 2015 7:31pm
Kevin Stephen
it's more sincere and personal than the other
Oct 05, 2015 7:29pm
Kevin Stephen
i think there is something here
Oct 05, 2015 7:29pm
Taras Holovko
or something??
Oct 05, 2015 7:19pm
Taras Holovko
there is still something good there
Oct 05, 2015 7:19pm
Taras Holovko
like even though everything sucks
Oct 05, 2015 7:19pm
Taras Holovko
i think it could be really specific
Oct 05, 2015 7:19pm
Taras Holovko
hmm
Oct 05, 2015 7:19pm
Kevin Stephen
the universality of sincere work&effort is an option
Oct 05, 2015 7:18pm
Taras Holovko
i think that 's too unfocused
Oct 05, 2015 7:18pm
Kevin Stephen
or about the different senses of independence between here and ukraine
Oct 05, 2015 7:18pm
Taras Holovko
yeah i want a more specific conclusion
Oct 05, 2015 7:18pm
Kevin Stephen
it could be about maturing but that's really general
Oct 05, 2015 7:17pm
Kevin Stephen
hm
Oct 05, 2015 7:17pm
Taras Holovko
im not sure what i want the takeaway to be
Oct 05, 2015 7:17pm
Taras Holovko
the concept is more important
Oct 05, 2015 7:17pm
Taras Holovko
the writing can be quickly changed
Oct 05, 2015 7:16pm
Taras Holovko
what should be the takeaway
Oct 05, 2015 7:16pm
Taras Holovko
i mean the concept
Oct 05, 2015 7:16pm
Taras Holovko
yeah i understand that
Oct 05, 2015 7:16pm
Kevin Stephen
instead of always painting with a dramatic flourish
Oct 05, 2015 7:16pm
Kevin Stephen
it's necesary sometimes to blend in an element of the austere
Oct 05, 2015 7:16pm
Kevin Stephen
maybe bad phrasing i mean like
Oct 05, 2015 7:15pm
Taras Holovko
i dont understand
Oct 05, 2015 7:15pm
Taras Holovko
what do you mean an earnest vivid depiction
Oct 05, 2015 7:15pm
Taras Holovko
it's earnest
Oct 05, 2015 7:14pm
Kevin Stephen
and i think that may be what you're missing in all three CA drafts you've written
Oct 05, 2015 7:14pm
Kevin Stephen
not necessarily a great dramatic portrayal but an earnest, vivid depiction of your story
Oct 05, 2015 7:14pm
Kevin Stephen
because that's what admissions officers are looking for
Oct 05, 2015 7:13pm
Kevin Stephen
maybe focus less on the poetic conventions and more on a sincere reflection of self
Oct 05, 2015 7:13pm
Kevin Stephen
okay
Oct 05, 2015 7:12pm
Taras Holovko
that's exactly what I'm trying to figure out
Oct 05, 2015 7:11pm
Kevin Stephen
what do you want this essay to say about you?
Oct 05, 2015 7:11pm
Kevin Stephen
it does
Oct 05, 2015 7:11pm
Taras Holovko
rn it feels really strongly loss of innocence
Oct 05, 2015 7:08pm
Taras Holovko
need help shaping concept

Taras Holovko
yeah oh man
Oct 03, 2015 11:06pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah section 9 is like a killer for me
Oct 03, 2015 11:05pm
Taras Holovko
At a point when I was so tired
Oct 03, 2015 11:05pm
Taras Holovko
so that added a certain degree of pressure
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Taras Holovko
Were 8 and 9
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah it kills your brain
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Taras Holovko
And my math sections
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Taras Holovko
Such extended focus
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Taras Holovko
But the focus
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Taras Holovko
Not the material
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah ik
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Taras Holovko
SAT is absolutely draining
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Taras Holovko
And with that I'm going to bed
Oct 03, 2015 11:04pm
Kevin Stephen
Ditto to that dude
Oct 03, 2015 10:53pm
Kevin Stephen
Word up
Oct 03, 2015 10:53pm
Taras Holovko
Because it gives me power over something so potent at a time in my life when little else seems certain
Oct 03, 2015 10:53pm
Kevin Stephen
Because you can go wherever you want haha
Oct 03, 2015 10:53pm
Taras Holovko
You know why I enjoy driving so much
Oct 03, 2015 10:53pm
Kevin Stephen
it is haha i'm just joking
Oct 03, 2015 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
i prefer to think of it as something more constructive
Oct 03, 2015 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
not blew
Oct 03, 2015 10:34pm
Taras Holovko
yep
Oct 03, 2015 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
lol blew $600 in five minutes
Oct 03, 2015 10:33pm
Taras Holovko
okay
Oct 03, 2015 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
so we can get our names on that wall
Oct 03, 2015 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
gotta email the trustees and see what we can sponsor
Oct 03, 2015 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
that's why i needed the other $500 haha
Oct 03, 2015 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
(which we can pick and get our names on the plaque)
Oct 03, 2015 10:33pm
Taras Holovko
okay that's fine then
Oct 03, 2015 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
i'd agree that it mingled religion if we were just like donating to the church but we only donated to sponsor the construction of XYZ item
Oct 03, 2015 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
but a sponsorship of a specific project
Oct 03, 2015 10:32pm
Kevin Stephen
in that it wasn't just a religious donation
Oct 03, 2015 10:32pm
Kevin Stephen
like we got $1000 from unity bank and they listed themselves as "proud sponsors"
Oct 03, 2015 10:32pm
Taras Holovko
alright
Oct 03, 2015 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
but secular organizations donate to churches all the time
Oct 03, 2015 10:31pm
Taras Holovko
not that I'm against it
Oct 03, 2015 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah true
Oct 03, 2015 10:31pm
Taras Holovko
is that mingles religion
Oct 03, 2015 10:31pm
Taras Holovko
with the church
Oct 03, 2015 10:31pm
Taras Holovko
my one concern
Oct 03, 2015 10:31pm
Taras Holovko
agreed
Oct 03, 2015 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
otherwise it looks like we're using the company's money to advance our personal charity interests
Oct 03, 2015 10:30pm
Taras Holovko
yes agreed
Oct 03, 2015 10:30pm
Kevin Stephen
but what we've supported as a company
Oct 03, 2015 10:30pm
Kevin Stephen
on the site it shouldn't be like what you've sponsored and what i've sponsored
Oct 03, 2015 10:30pm
Kevin Stephen
oh hm idts
Oct 03, 2015 10:30pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Oct 03, 2015 10:29pm
Taras Holovko
or list or something
Oct 03, 2015 10:29pm
Taras Holovko

Oct 03, 2015 10:29pm
Kevin Stephen
https://onetoday.google.com/page/refugeerelief
https://onetoday.google.com/page/refugeerelief?c=US&hl=en-US

Kevin Stephen
lol because that will not pull clients
Oct 03, 2015 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
right
Oct 03, 2015 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
until admissions
Oct 03, 2015 10:23pm
Taras Holovko
nothing about ECs
Oct 03, 2015 10:23pm

Oct 03, 2015 9:47pm

Taras Holovko

Oct 03, 2015 9:39pm
Taras Holovko
and I'm thinking admissions officers
Oct 03, 2015 9:39pm
Taras Holovko
because it's not active at all
Oct 03, 2015 9:39pm
Taras Holovko
but we need to make an active FB page
Oct 03, 2015 9:39pm
Kevin Stephen
but we should make a post after we donate to syria
Oct 03, 2015 9:39pm
Taras Holovko
no clients
Oct 03, 2015 9:39pm
Kevin Stephen
aka not attracting clients

Taras Holovko

Oct 03, 2015 9:38pm
Kevin Stephen
it needs to be presented right
Oct 03, 2015 9:38pm
Taras Holovko
that's not too much of a concern
Oct 03, 2015 9:38pm
Taras Holovko
we can just use the handouts we have
Oct 03, 2015 9:38pm
Kevin Stephen

Oct 03, 2015 9:18pm
Taras Holovko
he said it can't be
Oct 03, 2015 9:18pm
Kevin Stephen
sure it can
Oct 03, 2015 9:18pm
Taras Holovko
it can't be fixed
Oct 03, 2015 9:18pm
Taras Holovko
that's a huge problem
Oct 03, 2015 9:18pm
Taras Holovko
i agree 100%
Oct 03, 2015 9:18pm
Taras Holovko
pranav
Oct 03, 2015 9:18pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen

Oct 03, 2015 9:17pm
Kevin Stephen
who designed the DoS form

Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen

Sep 30, 2015 9:43pm
Kevin Stephen
lolol except it took you how many times to get the perfect SAT score?
Sep 30, 2015 9:43pm
Taras Holovko
That's crazy
Sep 30, 2015 9:40pm
Taras Holovko
ACT, SAT, PSAT, SAT 2, AP
Sep 30, 2015 9:40pm
Taras Holovko
I have literally THE perfect testing record
Sep 30, 2015 9:40pm
Taras Holovko
If I get a 2400
Sep 30, 2015 9:40pm
Taras Holovko
Now it's so natural
Sep 30, 2015 9:40pm
Taras Holovko
Like when I took practice tests last year I would question answers sometimes
Sep 30, 2015 9:40pm
Taras Holovko
Nah dude I'm really confident lol
Sep 30, 2015 9:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Fourth times the charm haha
Sep 30, 2015 9:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Lol if you don't get a 2400 this time
Sep 30, 2015 9:39pm
Taras Holovko
and still got a 2400
Sep 30, 2015 9:34pm
Taras Holovko
missed a page of questions
Sep 30, 2015 9:34pm
Taras Holovko
i finished the whole thing in 2 hours lol
Sep 30, 2015 9:34pm
Taras Holovko
i took an sat
Sep 30, 2015 9:34pm
Kevin Stephen
prob some stupid mistake haha
Sep 30, 2015 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
101
Sep 30, 2015 9:33pm
Taras Holovko
you?
Sep 30, 2015 9:32pm
Taras Holovko
103
Sep 30, 2015 9:32pm
Kevin Stephen
what'd you cop on discrete
Sep 30, 2015 9:24pm
Kevin Stephen
ok time for math hw
Sep 28, 2015 7:10pm
Kevin Stephen
they're uneven
Sep 28, 2015 7:10pm
Kevin Stephen
lmao
Sep 28, 2015 7:10pm
Taras Holovko
nvm
Sep 28, 2015 7:10pm
Taras Holovko
in the pic
Sep 28, 2015 7:10pm
Taras Holovko
i was trying to squint
Sep 28, 2015 7:10pm
Taras Holovko
lol
Sep 28, 2015 7:10pm
Taras Holovko
that's the idea
Sep 28, 2015 7:10pm
Kevin Stephen
your eyes are half closed dude haha
Sep 28, 2015 7:09pm
Taras Holovko
lol ok
Sep 28, 2015 7:09pm
Kevin Stephen
who gave you the idea that this was an attractive picture of you lolol

Sep 28, 2015 7:08pm
Kevin Stephen
also side note
Sep 28, 2015 7:08pm
Kevin Stephen
!!!! haha
Sep 28, 2015 7:07pm
Kevin Stephen
and i'll get into wharton
Sep 28, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
admissions officers will look for what's there more than what's not
Sep 28, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
but at the end of the day
Sep 28, 2015 7:07pm
Kevin Stephen
maybe we're just focusing too much on the minutiae
Sep 28, 2015 7:07pm
Kevin Stephen
yeahh
Sep 28, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
and all of them are garbage if you analyze them appropriately
Sep 28, 2015 7:06pm
Taras Holovko
i read all the essays in that folder we compiled
Sep 28, 2015 7:06pm
Taras Holovko
like dude
Sep 28, 2015 7:06pm
Kevin Stephen
i'll probably rewrite a significant portion of the essay
Sep 28, 2015 7:06pm
Taras Holovko
but at least i feel like i have an understanding of what's needed
Sep 28, 2015 7:06pm
Taras Holovko
exactly
Sep 28, 2015 7:06pm
Kevin Stephen
ah this is a tough task
Sep 28, 2015 7:06pm
Taras Holovko
that's my takeaway at least from all of this
Sep 28, 2015 7:05pm
Taras Holovko
yes
Sep 28, 2015 7:05pm
Kevin Stephen
so key words focus, clarity, and smallness
Sep 28, 2015 7:05pm
Taras Holovko
at least not as much as does the shorthand, because that's so much more minute and focused
Sep 28, 2015 7:04pm
Taras Holovko
it doesn't feel real
Sep 28, 2015 7:04pm
Taras Holovko
or casey's CA about him making a big speech
Sep 28, 2015 7:04pm
Taras Holovko
you know what i mean
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
like even jorge's can be seen as melodramatic at points
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
but because a true, genuine essay that speaks about you and suits admissions is so hard to find
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Kevin Stephen
because they're over-edited
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Kevin Stephen
i think both of ours are prob just as good as the ones we've seen in terms of originality
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
not because they were bad
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
half-baked
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
sooo poorly conceived
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
soooo*
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
soso cliche
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
like especially CA
Sep 28, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
looking back at the essays that casey, others sent to me
Sep 28, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
is that everyone is going to pick apart something
Sep 28, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
now the most important thing to remember i think
Sep 28, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
some of the best essays talk about the smallest of things
Sep 28, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
to choose something smaller
Sep 28, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
and the same applies for you
Sep 28, 2015 7:02pm
Kevin Stephen
yep i get that
Sep 28, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
like the message is well-reinforced, if not the one that i want
Sep 28, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
does that make sense
Sep 28, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
but it is a real essay
Sep 28, 2015 7:01pm
Taras Holovko
sure it tells less about me
Sep 28, 2015 7:01pm
Taras Holovko
now when i write about something smaller -- like the sincerity or hard work of that poverty in the case of my grandfather -- it feels much more genuine
Sep 28, 2015 7:01pm
Kevin Stephen
so step back from an observation about poverty and/or disability and focus the essay on something smaller, more personal
Sep 28, 2015 7:01pm
Taras Holovko
me vs poverty and juxtapose it it wouldn't work
Sep 28, 2015 7:01pm
Taras Holovko
when i tried to write about
Sep 28, 2015 7:01pm
Taras Holovko
like
Sep 28, 2015 7:01pm
Kevin Stephen
i see that
Sep 28, 2015 7:01pm
Taras Holovko
at least in the sense that it offers a vehicle to tell more about you?
Sep 28, 2015 7:00pm
Taras Holovko
so in choosing something minute you find security
Sep 28, 2015 7:00pm
Taras Holovko
authors
Sep 28, 2015 7:00pm
Taras Holovko
have all been expounded upon by so many authros
Sep 28, 2015 7:00pm
Taras Holovko
the big things like poverty, etc
Sep 28, 2015 7:00pm
Taras Holovko
i think the biggest thing is to focus on something more minute
Sep 28, 2015 7:00pm
Kevin Stephen
yeahh just experimenting
Sep 28, 2015 7:00pm
Taras Holovko
i would also be careful with the italics
Sep 28, 2015 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
the phrasing is really difficult to get just right
Sep 28, 2015 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
and when you tell
Sep 28, 2015 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
try to show rather than tell
Sep 28, 2015 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
or like what you feel
Sep 28, 2015 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
don't exaggerate what you see between her and you
Sep 28, 2015 6:59pm
Kevin Stephen
so less focus on the comparison between home and india
Sep 28, 2015 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
or like
Sep 28, 2015 6:59pm
Kevin Stephen
oh ok
Sep 28, 2015 6:58pm
Taras Holovko
it feels like you're trying to juxtapose US and India too much
Sep 28, 2015 6:58pm
Taras Holovko
less forced
Sep 28, 2015 6:58pm
Taras Holovko
try to make it more genuine
Sep 28, 2015 6:58pm
Taras Holovko
i would say
Sep 28, 2015 6:58pm
Taras Holovko
um
Sep 28, 2015 6:57pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah i agree
Sep 28, 2015 6:57pm
Taras Holovko
just the time
Sep 28, 2015 6:57pm
Taras Holovko
that intro is kinda cliche
Sep 28, 2015 6:57pm
Taras Holovko
4:45am
Sep 28, 2015 6:57pm
Taras Holovko
like
Sep 28, 2015 6:57pm
Kevin Stephen
ok yeah i agree
Sep 28, 2015 6:57pm
Taras Holovko
less details, more focus
Sep 28, 2015 6:56pm
Taras Holovko
biggest thing to focus on: less is more
Sep 28, 2015 6:56pm
Kevin Stephen
what did you think of the writing of mine in general
Sep 28, 2015 6:56pm
Kevin Stephen
btw
Sep 28, 2015 6:56pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah there's def a lack of "you" in this essay haha
Sep 28, 2015 6:56pm
Taras Holovko
and me
Sep 28, 2015 6:55pm
Taras Holovko
and talk about the land
Sep 28, 2015 6:55pm
Taras Holovko
i think i will chop that
Sep 28, 2015 6:55pm
Taras Holovko
"	When my mother was born, my grandfather – seasoned by years of working the earth – would wake up at five o’clock, kiss his sleeping daughter and wife goodbye, and step out to leave for the mine. There’s something fulfilling in hearing about the rhythm of the swing of his axe, the way that he whistled, knowing that it was a tune not of his spirit but of the spirit of those to whom he came home.
It’s not to say that my grandfather lacked intellect or was forced into the mine – I’d heard enough times how my mother outdid everyone in her class with a shrewdness that could only be seen in her father’s bright eyes – but for some reason he chose to pursue earth rather than dollar, and there is a certain intelligence in that too.
"
Sep 28, 2015 6:55pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah the progression of the story
Sep 28, 2015 6:54pm
Taras Holovko
and in logical flow too
Sep 28, 2015 6:54pm
Kevin Stephen
i think it can be cleaned up a lot in terms of clarity of thought

weighty questions hm
Sep 28, 2015 6:54pm
Taras Holovko
say i sent this in today
Sep 28, 2015 6:53pm
Taras Holovko
but as a whole?
Sep 28, 2015 6:53pm
Taras Holovko
there is definitely a more beautiful and profound way of saying that
Sep 28, 2015 6:53pm
Kevin Stephen
hm okay
Sep 28, 2015 6:52pm
Taras Holovko
not coal
Sep 28, 2015 6:52pm
Taras Holovko
vegetables
Sep 28, 2015 6:52pm
Taras Holovko
fruit
Sep 28, 2015 6:52pm
Kevin Stephen
green rather than black
Sep 28, 2015 6:52pm
Kevin Stephen
what does that mean?
Sep 28, 2015 6:52pm
Kevin Stephen
"There he tilled the soil, sowing it with blood and with tear, saw the real harvest of labor: green rather than black, warm rather than cold. "
Sep 28, 2015 6:52pm
Taras Holovko
okay
Sep 28, 2015 6:51pm
Kevin Stephen
but then again that's all your style
Sep 28, 2015 6:51pm
Kevin Stephen
because you're discussing coalmining and the simple beauty of work
Sep 28, 2015 6:51pm
Kevin Stephen
i think the writing perhaps could benefit from instances of austerity
Sep 28, 2015 6:51pm
Taras Holovko
do you have any suggestions and what do you think of the essay as it currently stands?
Sep 28, 2015 6:50pm
Taras Holovko
so there's a certain sense of balance in it all
Sep 28, 2015 6:50pm
Taras Holovko
in the sense that it's what my grandpa taught me
Sep 28, 2015 6:50pm
Taras Holovko
but then it starts moving toward cliche
Sep 28, 2015 6:50pm
Taras Holovko
and more about my time in Ukraine
Sep 28, 2015 6:50pm
Taras Holovko
more about the land
Sep 28, 2015 6:49pm
Taras Holovko
more about me
Sep 28, 2015 6:49pm
Taras Holovko
is make it less about my grandpa
Sep 28, 2015 6:49pm
Taras Holovko
i think the one big change i'm going to make
Sep 28, 2015 6:49pm
Kevin Stephen
mhm i get that
Sep 28, 2015 6:49pm
Taras Holovko
remember that foster shit
Sep 28, 2015 6:49pm
Taras Holovko
but at the same time it's all part of ONE story
Sep 28, 2015 6:49pm
Taras Holovko
that's so common it's unbelievable
Sep 28, 2015 6:49pm
Taras Holovko
anyone can write about that
Sep 28, 2015 6:48pm
Taras Holovko
and the liberation associated with it
Sep 28, 2015 6:48pm
Taras Holovko
talks about driving
Sep 28, 2015 6:48pm
Taras Holovko
their sample essay
Sep 28, 2015 6:48pm
Taras Holovko
if you look on AH.com
Sep 28, 2015 6:48pm
Taras Holovko
like it's supposed to be the small things
Sep 28, 2015 6:48pm
Kevin Stephen
i understand that
Sep 28, 2015 6:48pm
Taras Holovko
everyone has a grandfather
Sep 28, 2015 6:48pm
Taras Holovko
right but it's the way in which it's written
Sep 28, 2015 6:48pm
Kevin Stephen
like i could write the same exact story about my grandfather the rubber farmer and it'd probably work for me too
Sep 28, 2015 6:47pm
Kevin Stephen
but like i said it does tread on familiar territory
Sep 28, 2015 6:47pm
Taras Holovko
yes
Sep 28, 2015 6:47pm
Kevin Stephen
okay yeah so pretty close to what i mentioned
Sep 28, 2015 6:47pm
Taras Holovko
and while doing that, providing cultural background about my identity
Sep 28, 2015 6:45pm
Taras Holovko
by talking about someone other than myself
Sep 28, 2015 6:45pm
Taras Holovko
to the greatest extent it's meant to convey how much i value sincerity/hard work in living life
Sep 28, 2015 6:45pm
Taras Holovko
okay
Sep 28, 2015 6:44pm
Kevin Stephen
i see that you've ostensibly had a tough upbringing and have learned the sincerity and value of work. you value and reflect on the exuberance of a rugged existence haha
Sep 28, 2015 6:44pm
Kevin Stephen
that was my next question but i'll try to answer
Sep 28, 2015 6:43pm
Taras Holovko
in reading between the lines
Sep 28, 2015 6:43pm
Taras Holovko
from this essay what do you gather about me
Sep 28, 2015 6:42pm
Kevin Stephen
but then again @becca
Sep 28, 2015 6:42pm
Kevin Stephen
or even something that you can claim active participation and all
Sep 28, 2015 6:42pm
Kevin Stephen
don't know if it works as something central to your existence
Sep 28, 2015 6:42pm
Kevin Stephen
if that makes sense
Sep 28, 2015 6:42pm
Kevin Stephen
but i think this reveals more about your grandfather than it does about you
Sep 28, 2015 6:41pm
Kevin Stephen
although it does tread on familiar ground with a semi-traditional poor immigrant's ancestors story
Sep 28, 2015 6:41pm
Kevin Stephen
ok 1 this is not a cliche "this is what my grandpa taught me" essay
Sep 28, 2015 6:40pm
Kevin Stephen
hm yeahjust not sure how it fits in
Sep 28, 2015 6:39pm
Taras Holovko
Ok means I should either clarify or get rid of that
Sep 28, 2015 6:39pm
Taras Holovko
That's a lot of money in Ukraine
Sep 28, 2015 6:39pm
Taras Holovko
She gave me $50
Sep 28, 2015 6:39pm
Kevin Stephen
i don't get it
Sep 28, 2015 6:38pm
Kevin Stephen
what's the reference to the $50 from your aunt
Sep 28, 2015 6:38pm
Kevin Stephen
before i go further
Sep 28, 2015 6:38pm
Taras Holovko
lol thanks
Sep 28, 2015 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
I'll look at it rn
Sep 28, 2015 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
LOL wow okay
Sep 28, 2015 6:33pm
Taras Holovko
everyone else's opinion is dumb
Sep 28, 2015 6:32pm
Taras Holovko

2. can u do me a solid and read that damn CA essay more carefully - if you could give it just 5 min and answer 3 concerns I have: 1) it's too common / cliche, 2) it focuses too much on my grandpa, and 3) resultantly focuses not enough on me. I think I really need your opinion bc I can't find closure with what to do and am considering alternatives
Sep 28, 2015 6:30pm
Taras Holovko
1. let's work together on linear algebra

Kevin Stephen
hey
Sep 19, 2015 10:53pm
Taras Holovko
mm
Sep 19, 2015 8:00pm
Kevin Stephen
Foreign policy is presidents main field of responsibility
Sep 19, 2015 7:29pm
Kevin Stephen
Congress makes the budget and governs economic policy - the president has relatively little duty in that area
Sep 19, 2015 7:29pm
Kevin Stephen
But for the president, foreign policy trumps everything
Sep 19, 2015 7:28pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes
Sep 19, 2015 7:28pm
Taras Holovko
It governs elections
Sep 19, 2015 7:25pm
Taras Holovko
Economics is #1
Sep 19, 2015 7:25pm
Kevin Stephen
And if he wins the primary then the party is showing itself to be entirely illegitimate
Sep 19, 2015 7:19pm
Kevin Stephen
He's absurd
Sep 19, 2015 7:19pm
Kevin Stephen
That's exactly the reason I wouldn't vote for trump haha
Sep 19, 2015 7:19pm
Kevin Stephen
If not the most important
Sep 19, 2015 7:19pm
Kevin Stephen
Foreign policy is one of the most important areas of focus for the president
Sep 19, 2015 7:19pm
Taras Holovko
I hope you wouldn't vote for trump lol
Sep 19, 2015 7:18pm
Taras Holovko
Lol alright
Sep 19, 2015 7:18pm
Taras Holovko
Foreign policy is an insufficient factor to base decisions upon
Sep 19, 2015 7:18pm
Kevin Stephen
I can swallow a moderate republican much easier than a liberal
Sep 19, 2015 7:18pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm more centrist than you think
Sep 19, 2015 7:18pm
Taras Holovko
You barely agree with hem on their policies lol
Sep 19, 2015 7:18pm
Kevin Stephen
She did a great job as Secretary of State! @syria @benghazi
Sep 19, 2015 7:17pm
Kevin Stephen
Jeb Bush or Rubio would do a much better job than Clinton
Sep 19, 2015 7:17pm
Kevin Stephen
Nah
Sep 19, 2015 7:17pm
Taras Holovko
Better her than them
Sep 19, 2015 7:16pm
Taras Holovko
What about the republicans
Sep 19, 2015 7:16pm
Kevin Stephen
Would die if Clinton were elected
Sep 19, 2015 7:16pm
Kevin Stephen
I hope he gets the democratic ticket
Sep 19, 2015 7:15pm
Kevin Stephen
Well haha that's good
Sep 19, 2015 7:15pm
Taras Holovko
And Bernie sanders
Sep 19, 2015 7:15pm
Taras Holovko
Climate change
Sep 19, 2015 7:15pm
Taras Holovko
Among them the Y and its programs
Sep 19, 2015 7:15pm
Taras Holovko
There are very few causes I care about deeply and passionately
Sep 19, 2015 7:14pm
Kevin Stephen
Even well educated and monied minorities like Asians
Sep 19, 2015 7:11pm
Kevin Stephen
Minorities in general care less
Sep 19, 2015 7:11pm
Kevin Stephen
There's a chapter on voting trends that's why I asked
Sep 19, 2015 7:10pm
Taras Holovko
it's common sense
Sep 19, 2015 7:10pm
Taras Holovko
no
Sep 19, 2015 7:10pm
Kevin Stephen
Lol did you get to that chapter in gov yet
Sep 19, 2015 7:08pm
Taras Holovko
and i imagine that's especially true among minorities who don't have the time or money to follow politics
Sep 19, 2015 7:08pm
Taras Holovko
sanders lacks it
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
clinton has better name recognition
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
minimally so
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
no
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Kevin Stephen
Because of Black Lives Matter lol
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
and know of sanders
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
because none of them follow politics
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
you know why that's the case
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
his lack of appeal to minorities
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
it's everywhere
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
better to be active than not at all
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Kevin Stephen
Also didn't read that online haha
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Kevin Stephen
Never said you shouldn't support
Sep 19, 2015 7:07pm
Taras Holovko
but that won't stop me from supporting the campaign
Sep 19, 2015 7:06pm
Taras Holovko
lol
Sep 19, 2015 7:06pm
Taras Holovko
sure i can read that online too
Sep 19, 2015 7:06pm
Kevin Stephen
He can't take Hilary's lead
Sep 19, 2015 7:06pm
Kevin Stephen
Unless he connects to minorities esp African Americans
Sep 19, 2015 7:06pm
Kevin Stephen
Here's my take
Sep 19, 2015 7:06pm
Kevin Stephen
Lol Taras
Sep 19, 2015 7:06pm
Taras Holovko
that's INSANE
Sep 19, 2015 7:04pm
Taras Holovko
All of Bernie's biggest donations are from unions!
Sep 19, 2015 7:04pm
Kevin Stephen
Only till 3/4 way through the primaries but yeah you right
Sep 19, 2015 7:04pm
Taras Holovko
Hillary was at the top
Sep 19, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
Obama was the underdog
Sep 19, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
No
Sep 19, 2015 7:03pm
Kevin Stephen
Everyone expected the black man to win lol
Sep 19, 2015 7:03pm
Kevin Stephen
He raised $1.2m in two days this past week
Sep 19, 2015 7:03pm
Taras Holovko
no one expected a black man to win
Sep 19, 2015 7:03pm
Kevin Stephen
Except historically that hasn't worked though
Sep 19, 2015 7:03pm
Kevin Stephen
I agree with that
Sep 19, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
Like the perfect candidate
Sep 19, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
And anti establishment
Sep 19, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
Is so genuine
Sep 19, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
That he's rallying on such a grassroots level
Sep 19, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
That's so cool to me
Sep 19, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
It's that
Sep 19, 2015 7:02pm
Taras Holovko
And he gave $40 from his waiter paycheck
Sep 19, 2015 7:02pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha cool cool

Taras Holovko

Sep 19, 2015 7:00pm
Taras Holovko

Sep 03, 2015 3:55pm
Taras Holovko
I thought I responded on my computer
Sep 03, 2015 3:55pm
Taras Holovko
Did my message go through
Sep 03, 2015 3:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Thoughts
Sep 03, 2015 3:54pm
Kevin Stephen
what if we just keep $10/hour for the employee and give the rest to charity
Sep 03, 2015 3:33pm
Kevin Stephen
since students will now be paying variable rates with packages (down to $26.50 at the 18 hour)
Sep 03, 2015 3:33pm
Kevin Stephen
actually request
Sep 03, 2015 3:32pm
Kevin Stephen
also question
Sep 03, 2015 3:32pm
Kevin Stephen
i'd pay someone to do that
Sep 03, 2015 3:28pm
Kevin Stephen
that'd be gold
Sep 03, 2015 3:28pm
Kevin Stephen
and organize them into a doc
Sep 03, 2015 3:28pm
Kevin Stephen
so if someone who knows how to use a math writer could go through those ghetto-ass practice tests and pull questions by category
Sep 03, 2015 3:28pm
Taras Holovko
ah tru
Sep 03, 2015 3:28pm
Kevin Stephen
bc right now if someone takes a 12 or 18 hour package and we have to do more math hours then we're down to the blue book
Sep 03, 2015 3:27pm
Kevin Stephen
eh like practice questions like we have for writing
Sep 03, 2015 3:27pm
Taras Holovko
What math strategy lol
Sep 03, 2015 3:27pm
Kevin Stephen
and we'll hire some slaves to make our math strategy
Sep 03, 2015 3:26pm
Taras Holovko
I want to focus on 1) apps and 2) mun
Sep 03, 2015 3:26pm
Taras Holovko
Yes
Sep 03, 2015 3:26pm
Kevin Stephen
good?
Sep 03, 2015 3:26pm
Kevin Stephen
and just work with it starting in january
Sep 03, 2015 3:26pm
Kevin Stephen
in the meantime to expand strategy and stuff, we'll put the new SAT on hold
Sep 03, 2015 3:26pm
Kevin Stephen
Hm I agree
Sep 03, 2015 3:20pm
Taras Holovko
Bc if we over index on OTP, don't finish apps, and go to rutgers I will kms
Sep 03, 2015 3:15pm
Kevin Stephen
ok
Sep 03, 2015 3:12pm
Taras Holovko
I want to focus on getting into harvard or princeton or some crazy shit because if the company is characterized and advertised as such it will ultimately outperform than if we go to rutgers
Sep 03, 2015 3:11pm
Taras Holovko
I'm going to be totally frank
Sep 03, 2015 3:11pm
Taras Holovko
Ok but for now
Sep 03, 2015 3:11pm
Taras Holovko
But that requires so many things to happen Id rather not think about it
Sep 03, 2015 3:10pm
Kevin Stephen
that's true but you'd be older than most students
Sep 03, 2015 3:10pm
Taras Holovko
To return
Sep 03, 2015 3:10pm
Taras Holovko
I could drop out and would have 5 years
Sep 03, 2015 3:10pm
Taras Holovko
Say I got into harvard
Sep 03, 2015 3:10pm
Kevin Stephen
even if the company went six figures
Sep 03, 2015 3:10pm
Kevin Stephen
i wouldn't drop out
Sep 03, 2015 3:10pm
Kevin Stephen
lolol
Sep 03, 2015 3:10pm
Taras Holovko
Maybe drop out of college later on lmao
Sep 03, 2015 3:10pm
Taras Holovko

Sep 03, 2015 3:03pm
Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko
M&T

M&T is much harder
Sep 02, 2015 8:37pm
Taras Holovko

Sep 02, 2015 8:33pm
Taras Holovko
that's fine with me
Sep 02, 2015 8:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Not to be always quoting my dad but he's never given me bad advice before
Sep 02, 2015 8:29pm
Kevin Stephen
Lol my dad looked at the package system and said "don't be greedy you'll lose customers"
Sep 02, 2015 8:28pm
Kevin Stephen
We can increase to that later then
Sep 02, 2015 8:28pm
Kevin Stephen
That's true
Sep 02, 2015 8:28pm
Taras Holovko
You just take the package
Sep 02, 2015 8:28pm
Taras Holovko
You don't ask about the flat rate
Sep 02, 2015 8:28pm
Taras Holovko
When someone advertises prices
Sep 02, 2015 8:27pm
Taras Holovko
Think about it
Sep 02, 2015 8:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Well we can always increase prices later
Sep 02, 2015 8:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Lmao
Sep 02, 2015 8:27pm
Taras Holovko
People who don't know/ask about the flat rate
Sep 02, 2015 8:27pm
Kevin Stephen
$339 for 12? And $479 for 18
Sep 02, 2015 8:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeahh I mean I was thinking if the six hour package is more than $30, then who would ever buy it over the $30/hour flat rate
Sep 02, 2015 8:26pm
Taras Holovko
That gets us 20 hours lol
Sep 02, 2015 8:26pm
Taras Holovko
Devin *
Sep 02, 2015 8:25pm
Taras Holovko
Even if it's just for like Devon
Sep 02, 2015 8:25pm
Taras Holovko
Actually yeah you're probably right
Sep 02, 2015 8:25pm
Taras Holovko
I say keep as is
Sep 02, 2015 8:25pm
Kevin Stephen
6 hours for $179
Sep 02, 2015 8:25pm
Kevin Stephen
So that $30/hour is the 6 hour package
Sep 02, 2015 8:25pm
Kevin Stephen
I think we should lower prices a little
Sep 02, 2015 8:24pm
Kevin Stephen
Looks good
Sep 02, 2015 7:30pm
Kevin Stephen
Ok I read over and edited the letter

Aug 31, 2015 8:18am
Taras Holovko
Put 20
Aug 31, 2015 8:18am
Kevin Stephen
shouldn't put "unlimited" it's like we're trying to sell ourselves
Aug 31, 2015 8:17am
Kevin Stephen
hm okay so how many is that
Aug 31, 2015 8:17am
Taras Holovko
Well we can
Aug 31, 2015 8:17am
Kevin Stephen
rightt but are we giving out all those sketchy tests
Aug 31, 2015 8:17am
Taras Holovko
We have all the ones available from AH
Aug 31, 2015 8:16am
Kevin Stephen
i think rn we have like 10 tests
Aug 31, 2015 8:16am
Kevin Stephen
we can be honest in the spreadsheet lol AH's program is better than ours
Aug 31, 2015 8:16am
Kevin Stephen
yeah 15
Aug 31, 2015 8:16am
Taras Holovko
Like 15 I think
Aug 31, 2015 8:16am
Taras Holovko
they have too many available
Aug 31, 2015 8:16am
Kevin Stephen
And yeah you're right
Aug 31, 2015 8:14am
Kevin Stephen
I'll look
Aug 31, 2015 8:14am
Kevin Stephen
I'm pretty sure the # of practice tests is available for AH
Aug 31, 2015 8:14am
Kevin Stephen
This is good
Aug 31, 2015 8:14am
Taras Holovko
it should be sufficient as a rough guide
Aug 31, 2015 8:07am
Taras Holovko
let me know if this spreadsheet is fine
Aug 31, 2015 8:07am
Taras Holovko
aka give harder practice tests as a starting score
Aug 31, 2015 8:07am
Taras Holovko
is that they use dishonest methods to gauge score increase
Aug 31, 2015 8:07am
Taras Holovko
ok and the other concern
Aug 31, 2015 8:06am
Taras Holovko
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qI6aQ7fw8cB1YmrMP11kLQlsst7zf-vW7HHTXi40PRQ/edit

Kevin Stephen
For the Spanish journals
Aug 31, 2015 7:46am
Kevin Stephen
I mean it is but it's not logically feasible
Aug 31, 2015 7:46am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I agree
Aug 31, 2015 7:46am
Taras Holovko
Ok
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Taras Holovko
It's not really possible to develop a full curriculum
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah pretty much
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Kevin Stephen
There's like no strategies haha it's just going over tough material
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Taras Holovko
But like independent - each of us works on our own
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Kevin Stephen
We don't really need one
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Taras Holovko
Okay that's fine
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Taras Holovko
We don't have a method developed
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Kevin Stephen
No no lets just tell her we're developing a curriculum and we'll tutor him based on our own experience with the exams but still with the company
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Taras Holovko
You want to do it through Olympian
Aug 31, 2015 7:45am
Taras Holovko
What
Aug 31, 2015 7:44am
Kevin Stephen

Aug 31, 2015 7:44am
Taras Holovko

Aug 31, 2015 7:44am
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen
Oh I texted her asking if she could do 12:40
Aug 31, 2015 7:37am
Taras Holovko
11:40 means leaving practice early
Aug 31, 2015 7:37am
Taras Holovko

Dear Devin Busono,

On September 1, 2015, the price change that came into effect on July 1, 2015 will be applicable to all our students for the sake of consistency across the board. 
We wanted to honor your commitment, along with that of the rest of our students, for two more months before universalizing this fee change. Starting September 1, your rate will increase to $30 per hour of call time. The remainder of our resources, practice tests, essay feedback, and strategy documents will remain free. 

Thank you for your continued commitment and support. As you know, the majority of our income is donated to charities across the world, including the World Health Organization and the crowdfunded kiva.org. Thank you for helping us to make a difference!

i'll ask shags to sift through some ghetto practice tests?
Aug 24, 2015 1:13pm
Kevin Stephen
we need to add more
Aug 24, 2015 1:13pm
Kevin Stephen
i took out some of rushil's inaccurate practice questions
Aug 24, 2015 1:13pm
Kevin Stephen
technically faulty comparisons is part of parallelism, i saw it like that on a bunch of sites, but it's clearer cut this way
Aug 24, 2015 1:13pm
Kevin Stephen
writing section looks nicer now
Aug 24, 2015 1:12pm
Kevin Stephen
i think we should do something of that sort

"If you can find an SAT question that is not 100% explained by our grammar rules, we’ll refund your course in full. Guaranteed."
Aug 23, 2015 9:34am
Taras Holovko
You're right
Aug 23, 2015 9:30am
Taras Holovko
yes
Aug 23, 2015 9:30am
Kevin Stephen
am i right or no
Aug 23, 2015 9:26am
Kevin Stephen
so it doesn't make sense for us to drop it
Aug 23, 2015 9:26am
Kevin Stephen
but the SAT is our only source of income
Aug 23, 2015 9:25am
Taras Holovko
Alright
Aug 23, 2015 9:25am
Kevin Stephen
when they're making millions in consulting
Aug 23, 2015 9:25am
Kevin Stephen
that's because it's not profitable for them to adapt
Aug 23, 2015 9:25am
Kevin Stephen
and
Aug 23, 2015 9:25am
Kevin Stephen
i know
Aug 23, 2015 9:25am
Taras Holovko
Is dropping sat tutoring
Aug 23, 2015 9:24am
Taras Holovko
Look even AH
Aug 23, 2015 9:24am
Kevin Stephen
ok i'm not trying to argue i'm just giving my opinion
Aug 23, 2015 9:24am
Taras Holovko
It's far too late for that lol
Aug 23, 2015 9:24am
Taras Holovko
Being a tryhard at testing
Aug 23, 2015 9:24am
Taras Holovko
And for all I know I'm not going to get a 2400 if I take it again
Aug 23, 2015 9:24am
Taras Holovko
Not much left
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Taras Holovko
I'm at 36
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Taras Holovko
That's it
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Taras Holovko
I've invested many of those hours already
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Kevin Stephen
take or leave
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Kevin Stephen
just my advice
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Kevin Stephen
that you could do much better things with
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Kevin Stephen
that's a lot of hours you'll spend studying for the ACt
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Kevin Stephen
no it's not
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Taras Holovko
I'm taking the ACT refardless
Aug 23, 2015 9:23am
Taras Holovko
It's too late now
Aug 23, 2015 9:22am
Kevin Stephen
you have much better things to do with your time
Aug 23, 2015 9:22am
Kevin Stephen
imo just get the 2400 and leave it
Aug 23, 2015 9:22am
Kevin Stephen
you'll come off as tryhard with exams
Aug 23, 2015 9:22am
Kevin Stephen
it will reflect badly on your own resume for you to take the ACT now
Aug 23, 2015 9:22am
Kevin Stephen
no i mean
Aug 23, 2015 9:22am
Taras Holovko
Just not now
Aug 23, 2015 9:22am
Taras Holovko
Also I told you I'm genuinely interested in doing things with the ACT later
Aug 23, 2015 9:22am
Taras Holovko
And it was never a deterrent
Aug 23, 2015 9:21am
Taras Holovko
It never mattered in the first place...
Aug 23, 2015 9:21am
Kevin Stephen
taking both exams after having a near perfect score on the SAT
Aug 23, 2015 9:21am
Taras Holovko
What will
Aug 23, 2015 9:21am
Kevin Stephen
and you think this is going to look good to a college admissions officer
Aug 23, 2015 9:21am
Kevin Stephen
lol
Aug 23, 2015 9:21am
Taras Holovko
I'm doing that as well
Aug 23, 2015 9:20am
Kevin Stephen
why not just retake the SAT?
Aug 23, 2015 9:20am
Taras Holovko
2. For the future
Aug 23, 2015 9:20am
Taras Holovko
1. For admissions
Aug 23, 2015 9:20am
Kevin Stephen
so why are you taking the ACT then?
Aug 23, 2015 9:20am
Taras Holovko
To make an agenda of quality that we can proudly use for tutoring
Aug 23, 2015 9:20am
Taras Holovko
I just don't have the time
Aug 23, 2015 9:19am
Taras Holovko
And if I do, it won't be in the next four months
Aug 23, 2015 9:19am
Kevin Stephen
hm ok
Aug 23, 2015 9:19am
Taras Holovko
I don't have the same understanding of the test
Aug 23, 2015 9:19am
Taras Holovko
I can't find the same number of resources as available for the SAT
Aug 23, 2015 9:19am
Taras Holovko
I'm not going to develop a curriculum for it in my own
Aug 23, 2015 9:19am
Taras Holovko
I'm taking it for a number of reasons
Aug 23, 2015 9:18am
Kevin Stephen
i thought that's why you were taking the ACT.....
Aug 23, 2015 9:18am
Taras Holovko
I'm not doing ACT tutoring
Aug 23, 2015 9:18am

Taras Holovko
Come on weekends
Aug 23, 2015 9:15am
Taras Holovko
Obgliated to stay longer
Aug 23, 2015 9:15am
Taras Holovko
Leaders of the team
Aug 23, 2015 9:15am
Kevin Stephen
why is it different as seniors?
Aug 23, 2015 9:15am
Taras Holovko
That's a huge time commitment
Aug 23, 2015 9:15am
Taras Holovko
And we're seniors
Aug 23, 2015 9:15am
Taras Holovko
We're doing XC
Aug 23, 2015 9:15am
Taras Holovko
Also
Aug 23, 2015 9:15am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah same
Aug 23, 2015 9:14am
Taras Holovko
that's imo a big priorit
Aug 23, 2015 9:13am
Taras Holovko
i really really want to get that in
Aug 23, 2015 9:13am
Taras Holovko
oh yeah
Aug 23, 2015 9:13am
Taras Holovko
seminars
Aug 23, 2015 9:13am
Taras Holovko
all our old stuff seems to be done then
Aug 23, 2015 9:13am
Taras Holovko
ok ill work on all that you look into the new SAT
Aug 23, 2015 9:12am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Aug 23, 2015 9:12am
Kevin Stephen
Let's get the essentials done first
Aug 23, 2015 9:12am
Taras Holovko
pictures, bios, strategies, stats, essay generator
Aug 23, 2015 9:12am
Kevin Stephen
But that's low priority
Aug 23, 2015 9:12am
Kevin Stephen
So it'd be a matter of adjusting fonts and pictures and all
Aug 23, 2015 9:12am
Taras Holovko
i think there are some simple changes we can make that will hold for a while
Aug 23, 2015 9:12am
Taras Holovko
okay
Aug 23, 2015 9:12am
Kevin Stephen
Remember when we change themes all the stuff carries over
Aug 23, 2015 9:12am
Kevin Stephen
Nah not really
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Taras Holovko
that'll be hella long lol
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Kevin Stephen
Maybe not now
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Taras Holovko
to a new theme entirely?
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Taras Holovko
you want to change the site format then?
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Taras Holovko
okay
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Kevin Stephen
That's why we're finishing it all this week
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Taras Holovko
alright
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Kevin Stephen
But we're not
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Kevin Stephen
Lolol you right
Aug 23, 2015 9:11am
Taras Holovko
and this is the one period in HS where i don't want to risk taking on too much
Aug 23, 2015 9:10am
Taras Holovko
this is just a lot of time
Aug 23, 2015 9:10am
Taras Holovko
i think it would be cool
Aug 23, 2015 9:10am
Kevin Stephen
Why not
Aug 23, 2015 9:10am
Taras Holovko
perhaps
Aug 23, 2015 9:10am
Kevin Stephen
I think it'd be really cool
Aug 23, 2015 9:10am
Kevin Stephen
That was her idea
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Taras Holovko
ah
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Kevin Stephen
Keerthana wants to be our blog writer
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Taras Holovko
but like
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Taras Holovko
not that they would do shitty work
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Taras Holovko
company model and all
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Taras Holovko
i mean I'm looking at it from like a professional perspective
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Kevin Stephen
You haven't seen anything that they've done
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Taras Holovko
and they're already paid for the company
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Taras Holovko
because they don't get paid for creating docs
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Kevin Stephen
Well you can't say that
Aug 23, 2015 9:09am
Taras Holovko
they don't have a motivation to make it v good
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Kevin Stephen
Lol those were from his tutoring company
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Taras Holovko
lol
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Taras Holovko
i was like "wtf is this shit"
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Kevin Stephen
I'll forward you a doc that Keera sent me last week
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Taras Holovko
like rushil parallelism examples
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Taras Holovko
is because it may not be quality
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Kevin Stephen
damn CB
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Taras Holovko
the reason I'm afraid of asking others to do work
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Taras Holovko
lol welp
Aug 23, 2015 9:08am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah we may have to throw out the whole thing but idk
Aug 23, 2015 9:07am
Kevin Stephen
And our samples are obsolete
Aug 23, 2015 9:07am
Kevin Stephen
And edit a lot
Aug 23, 2015 9:07am
Kevin Stephen
We have to expand it
Aug 23, 2015 9:07am
Kevin Stephen
Essay I think you're right
Aug 23, 2015 9:07am
Kevin Stephen
I'll have to look at a blue book and see
Aug 23, 2015 9:07am
Taras Holovko
critical reading our method maybe to some extent
Aug 23, 2015 9:07am
Taras Holovko
i don't think the essay stuff is at all anymore
Aug 23, 2015 9:06am
Taras Holovko
are the writing rules still applicable?
Aug 23, 2015 9:06am
Taras Holovko
also let's see
Aug 23, 2015 9:06am
Taras Holovko
we'll have old SAT clients on a limited basis until the January SAT
Aug 23, 2015 9:06am
Kevin Stephen
Okay then I'll work with the rest of our employees this week
Aug 23, 2015 9:06am
Taras Holovko
lets see
Aug 23, 2015 9:06am
Taras Holovko
not a physical book
Aug 23, 2015 9:05am
Taras Holovko
i don't have access to the new SAT stuff
Aug 23, 2015 9:05am
Taras Holovko
time commitment worries me
Aug 23, 2015 9:03am
Taras Holovko
hm
Aug 23, 2015 9:03am
Kevin Stephen
we'll be ahead of the game now, behind the game in January
Aug 23, 2015 9:03am
Kevin Stephen
Kids are already asking
Aug 23, 2015 9:03am
Kevin Stephen
I think too late
Aug 23, 2015 9:03am
Taras Holovko
too late then?
Aug 23, 2015 9:03am
Taras Holovko
why can't we start in january
Aug 23, 2015 9:03am
Taras Holovko
new sat now too lol
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Taras Holovko
i have so much to do
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Taras Holovko
ugh fuck
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Kevin Stephen
I'm ordering a blue book
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Taras Holovko
okay
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Taras Holovko
i gotcha
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Kevin Stephen
That's all
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Kevin Stephen
We just need to revamp
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Taras Holovko
if we continue into the spring
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Kevin Stephen
It's not entirely different
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Taras Holovko
yeah
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Kevin Stephen
Either way we need to develop a curriculum for the new exam
Aug 23, 2015 9:02am
Taras Holovko
not entirely sure
Aug 23, 2015 9:01am
Taras Holovko
idk
Aug 23, 2015 9:01am
Kevin Stephen
What about you
Aug 23, 2015 9:01am
Taras Holovko
okay hm
Aug 23, 2015 9:00am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah sort of
Aug 23, 2015 9:00am
Kevin Stephen
And we could hire other people to do tutoring
Aug 23, 2015 9:00am
Taras Holovko
another admissions hero type thing?
Aug 23, 2015 9:00am
Kevin Stephen
In college I was thinking of expanding past just test prep and making it a consulting company
Aug 23, 2015 9:00am
Taras Holovko
into college and all
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Kevin Stephen
Continuing?
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Taras Holovko
then
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Taras Holovko
continuing?
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Taras Holovko
after january
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Taras Holovko
what are we doing with olympian
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Taras Holovko
no like
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Kevin Stephen
What does that mean
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Taras Holovko
what do you want to do
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Taras Holovko
or not even plan
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Taras Holovko
into college
Aug 23, 2015 8:59am
Taras Holovko
what's our plan for january and onward
Aug 23, 2015 8:58am
Kevin Stephen
We only have no experience because we haven't looked at the new exam yet
Aug 23, 2015 8:58am
Kevin Stephen
It's also not lucrative to lose all our students after the March exam....?
Aug 23, 2015 8:57am
Taras Holovko
that's not the prbo
Aug 23, 2015 8:57am
Taras Holovko
it's not even lucrative
Aug 23, 2015 8:57am
Taras Holovko
and i don't want to cheat people out of money for an exam i have 0 experience with
Aug 23, 2015 8:57am
Taras Holovko
i don't think it's going to be lucrative to be totally honest
Aug 23, 2015 8:57am
Kevin Stephen
Were you planning on just not adapting to the new SAT? We have to do it eventually haha this is probably the best time
Aug 23, 2015 8:56am
Taras Holovko
uh
Aug 23, 2015 8:56am
Kevin Stephen
And we can make a post on FB and all that stuff
Aug 23, 2015 8:55am
Kevin Stephen
Because I told Kira smith that it'll be ready by Sept 1
Aug 23, 2015 8:55am
Kevin Stephen
For the new exam
Aug 23, 2015 8:55am
Kevin Stephen
The whole new curriculum
Aug 23, 2015 8:55am
Taras Holovko
just the site and writing examples / strategy need to be finalized
Aug 23, 2015 8:55am
Taras Holovko
what remains to be done
Aug 23, 2015 8:55am
Taras Holovko
ok well
Aug 23, 2015 8:55am
Kevin Stephen
Whatever we're doing this week we could use their help
Aug 23, 2015 8:55am
Kevin Stephen
Nevertheless
Aug 23, 2015 8:54am
Kevin Stephen
But Keera wants to really be a part of it
Aug 23, 2015 8:54am
Kevin Stephen
Shagun and Ila I don't really believe will do a lot
Aug 23, 2015 8:54am
Kevin Stephen
Keerthana will work
Aug 23, 2015 8:54am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah we're launching our new SAT program on September 1
Aug 23, 2015 8:54am
Taras Holovko
there's no incentive for shagun, keerthana, or Ila to do stuff because they're all busy
Aug 23, 2015 8:54am
Taras Holovko
i think we should finish our resources and site in the next week and call it a day until january 1
Aug 23, 2015 8:53am
Kevin Stephen
I haven't heard from him in like 10 years
Aug 23, 2015 8:53am
Kevin Stephen
Is he still willing to work
Aug 23, 2015 8:53am
Taras Holovko
damn rushil
Aug 23, 2015 8:52am
Kevin Stephen
I didn't like them either
Aug 23, 2015 8:52am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah those were rushils examples
Aug 23, 2015 8:52am
Taras Holovko
or like a misplaced comma
Aug 23, 2015 8:52am
Taras Holovko
and marked them as incorrect
Aug 23, 2015 8:52am
Taras Holovko
it was like testing the inclusion of "the" and "by"
Aug 23, 2015 8:52am
Kevin Stephen
We can change words and it'll be fine
Aug 23, 2015 8:52am
Taras Holovko
biggest problem was in the parallelism practice probs i think
Aug 23, 2015 8:52am
Kevin Stephen
Nah it still is because it's word for word
Aug 23, 2015 8:51am
Taras Holovko
but yeah i feel
Aug 23, 2015 8:50am
Taras Holovko
the sentence itself isn't much of an idea lol
Aug 23, 2015 8:50am
Taras Holovko
so explanations counts as plagiarism
Aug 23, 2015 8:50am
Taras Holovko
plagiarism is ideas
Aug 23, 2015 8:50am
Kevin Stephen
Lol plagiarism dude
Aug 23, 2015 8:50am
Taras Holovko
ok
Aug 23, 2015 8:50am
Kevin Stephen
And I don't want to cite to another source
Aug 23, 2015 8:50am
Kevin Stephen
Unless we cite them
Aug 23, 2015 8:49am
Taras Holovko
ok
Aug 23, 2015 8:49am
Kevin Stephen
We shouldn't use them word for word
Aug 23, 2015 8:49am
Taras Holovko
the blog post
Aug 23, 2015 8:49am
Kevin Stephen
Whose
Aug 23, 2015 8:49am
Taras Holovko
can we use their examples
Aug 23, 2015 8:49am
Kevin Stephen
I'll look
Aug 23, 2015 8:47am
Taras Holovko
but you're right
Aug 23, 2015 8:47am
Taras Holovko
i mean it'll be defunct in a few months
Aug 23, 2015 8:47am
Kevin Stephen
That's not allowed lol
Aug 23, 2015 8:47am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah
Aug 23, 2015 8:47am
Kevin Stephen
So I'd advise against copying examples
Aug 23, 2015 8:47am
Taras Holovko
mm well then some of the examples need to be changed
Aug 23, 2015 8:47am
Kevin Stephen
Not a copy of the blog post
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Kevin Stephen
I want it to be our own
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Taras Holovko
on the last portion of the writing section
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Kevin Stephen
Just don't copy
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Taras Holovko
i added the stuff from the old PDF
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Taras Holovko
because it's confusing and maybe can be organized better
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I think that was in one of my comments the dangling modifiers
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Taras Holovko
is the portion on FANBOYS and independent clauses
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Taras Holovko
only thing that needs edits
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Kevin Stephen
Ok
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Taras Holovko
yep
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Kevin Stephen
Did you add that in
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Taras Holovko
added
Aug 23, 2015 8:46am
Kevin Stephen
Is dangling modifiers
Aug 23, 2015 8:45am
Kevin Stephen
One thing we're missing that our students always miss
Aug 23, 2015 8:45am
Taras Holovko
alright i finished writing rules
Aug 23, 2015 8:45am
Kevin Stephen
Ok I'll take a look
Aug 23, 2015 8:45am
Kevin Stephen
But eventually
Aug 23, 2015 8:45am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah not now necessarily
Aug 23, 2015 8:45am
Taras Holovko
this way, we can transition into the rules for improving sentences on pages 11-14 on the blog post PDF we used in the past
Aug 23, 2015 7:43am
Taras Holovko
ok i restructured writing so rules 14 and 15 are conjunctions/connectors and sentence structure
Aug 23, 2015 7:43am
Taras Holovko
we're going to be busy as is with senior fall
Aug 23, 2015 7:20am
Taras Holovko
and just maintaining customers for the next few months
Aug 23, 2015 7:20am
Taras Holovko
let's focus on the seminars
Aug 23, 2015 7:20am
Taras Holovko
comprehensive site changes can always be done at some later point
Aug 23, 2015 7:20am
Taras Holovko
so we should stick to more simple alterations for now
Aug 23, 2015 7:18am
Taras Holovko
my one concern is that we're not going to have time to do all this
Aug 23, 2015 7:18am
Taras Holovko
hm okay
Aug 23, 2015 7:18am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I had a bunch of ideas
Aug 23, 2015 7:15am
Taras Holovko
um you want to change it soon?
Aug 23, 2015 7:15am
Kevin Stephen
Avada
Aug 23, 2015 7:15am
Kevin Stephen
Arvada
Aug 23, 2015 7:15am
Taras Holovko
other one is fine too
Aug 23, 2015 7:15am
Taras Holovko
yeah it's not bad
Aug 23, 2015 7:13am
Taras Holovko
enfold ?
Aug 23, 2015 7:13am
Kevin Stephen
Did you look at the theme that I suggested in the GC
Aug 23, 2015 7:12am
Kevin Stephen
I'll take a look
Aug 23, 2015 7:11am
Kevin Stephen
That's fine
Aug 23, 2015 7:11am
Taras Holovko
lmk if you're opposed to that
Aug 23, 2015 7:11am
Taras Holovko
may be 15 by the end of the hour
Aug 23, 2015 7:10am
Taras Holovko
there are now 14
Aug 23, 2015 7:10am
Taras Holovko
um i made a good number of changes to the writing rules
Aug 23, 2015 7:10am
Taras Holovko
ok
Aug 23, 2015 7:10am
Kevin Stephen
I'll share them w you
Aug 23, 2015 7:10am
Kevin Stephen
And she has a bunch of good ideas that she talked to me about
Aug 23, 2015 7:10am
Kevin Stephen
She's helped me with Devin 
Graded nearly all his practice tests and broke down all the answers into question types
Aug 23, 2015 7:10am
Taras Holovko
what has keera done
Aug 23, 2015 7:09am
Kevin Stephen
Shagun lol
Aug 23, 2015 7:09am
Kevin Stephen
Keerthana has done stuff tho
Aug 23, 2015 7:09am
Taras Holovko
lol
Aug 23, 2015 7:09am
Taras Holovko
@casey
Aug 23, 2015 7:09am
Taras Holovko
@shagun @keera
Aug 23, 2015 7:09am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah haha @rushil
Aug 23, 2015 7:08am
Kevin Stephen
This is true
Aug 23, 2015 7:08am
Taras Holovko
AH has a requirement that any employee must work a minimum of 8 hours a week
Aug 23, 2015 7:08am
Taras Holovko
also 4-5 of them haven't really tutored anyone
Aug 23, 2015 7:08am
Taras Holovko
just founders/etc
Aug 23, 2015 7:08am
Taras Holovko
they never list all the tutors
Aug 23, 2015 7:07am
Taras Holovko
never done on professional sites
Aug 23, 2015 7:07am
Kevin Stephen
Why not all 7?
Aug 23, 2015 7:05am
Taras Holovko
5. update stats/any other remaining info
Aug 23, 2015 5:29am
Taras Holovko
4. add the essay prompt generator as a page
Aug 23, 2015 5:28am
Taras Holovko
3. update the strategy page since it's so bare
Aug 23, 2015 5:28am
Taras Holovko
2. pictures of college campuses as all the backgrounds need to be changed
Aug 23, 2015 5:28am
Taras Holovko
1. bios - don't put all seven. instead, just put a mission statement page and a few brief sentences about the two of us. make it more about the company than individuals
Aug 23, 2015 5:28am
Taras Holovko
here are the site edits i think we need
Aug 23, 2015 5:27am
Taras Holovko
odd
Aug 22, 2015 7:10pm
Kevin Stephen
Lolol
Aug 22, 2015 7:09pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 22, 2015 2:24pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 22, 2015 2:24pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Aug 22, 2015 2:24pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 22, 2015 2:23pm
Kevin Stephen

Aug 21, 2015 10:03pm
Kevin Stephen
Then we can do it for sure
Aug 21, 2015 9:23pm
Kevin Stephen
But if we have a group of us working on it
Aug 21, 2015 9:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Easier said than done
Aug 21, 2015 9:22pm
Kevin Stephen
I'll just learn it next week and develop a curriculum
Aug 21, 2015 9:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Not very different from this SAT
Aug 21, 2015 9:22pm
Kevin Stephen
I looked through a blue book at BN last week
Aug 21, 2015 9:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Haha not a problem
Aug 21, 2015 9:20pm
Taras Holovko
I have no idea how we're going to tutor either for that or the ACT

Aug 18, 2015 6:46pm
Taras Holovko
lol they told us it couldn't be done in high school
Aug 18, 2015 6:46pm
Kevin Stephen
yeahh but you'd be starting from the bottom of the ladder
Aug 18, 2015 6:46pm
Taras Holovko
very attractive option to me if i could try to graduate in 2 years
Aug 18, 2015 6:45pm
Taras Holovko
exactly
Aug 18, 2015 6:45pm
Kevin Stephen
damn

Aug 18, 2015 6:44pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 6:43pm
Taras Holovko
right
Aug 18, 2015 6:43pm
Kevin Stephen
you're only in the honors college for one year
Aug 18, 2015 6:43pm
Kevin Stephen
after the first year they relocate you to the regular college
Aug 18, 2015 6:43pm
Taras Holovko
what do you mean
Aug 18, 2015 6:43pm
Kevin Stephen
i'd have to spend the other 1.5 in regular college
Aug 18, 2015 6:42pm
Kevin Stephen
like after the 1st year
Aug 18, 2015 6:42pm
Kevin Stephen
rutgers honors college would be a really attractive option if it were all four years
Aug 18, 2015 6:42pm
Kevin Stephen
NICE
Aug 18, 2015 6:42pm
Taras Holovko
antithesis of nitz
Aug 18, 2015 6:42pm

Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 6:41pm
Taras Holovko
yeah def
Aug 18, 2015 6:41pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm sure i'll be able to make friends without partying hard and such
Aug 18, 2015 6:41pm
Kevin Stephen
but it just depends who you associate with
Aug 18, 2015 6:41pm
Taras Holovko
playboy ranked penn the number 1 party school in the US
Aug 18, 2015 6:40pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah yeah i know
Aug 18, 2015 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
most party-oriented
Aug 18, 2015 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
but it's like the most social ivy
Aug 18, 2015 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
i don't want to mar your view of penn
Aug 18, 2015 6:40pm
Kevin Stephen
i found princeton a little too small & rural
Aug 18, 2015 6:40pm
Kevin Stephen
why not my ivy?
Aug 18, 2015 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
i think you'd like Princeton more
Aug 18, 2015 6:39pm
Taras Holovko
not your ivy
Aug 18, 2015 6:39pm
Kevin Stephen
probably a good idea
Aug 18, 2015 6:39pm
Taras Holovko
idk if you'd like it
Aug 18, 2015 6:39pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah
Aug 18, 2015 6:39pm
Taras Holovko
if i were you i would first visit penn
Aug 18, 2015 6:39pm
Kevin Stephen
with a quarter of a million dollars
Aug 18, 2015 6:39pm
Kevin Stephen
so it's a gamble
Aug 18, 2015 6:39pm
Kevin Stephen
hm interesting
Aug 18, 2015 6:38pm
Taras Holovko
and then considered regular for both M&T and wharton
Aug 18, 2015 6:38pm
Taras Holovko
that being said i think you'll get deferred if you don't get into M&T
Aug 18, 2015 6:38pm
Kevin Stephen
ED is like 20%
Aug 18, 2015 6:38pm

Taras Holovko
will be listed as a second choice so you'll get into that for sure
Aug 18, 2015 6:37pm
Kevin Stephen
wharton as a whole is totally worth
Aug 18, 2015 6:37pm
Kevin Stephen
it's the best of its kind
Aug 18, 2015 6:37pm
Taras Holovko
right but Wharton as a whole
Aug 18, 2015 6:37pm
Kevin Stephen
but worth applying
Aug 18, 2015 6:37pm
Kevin Stephen
it takes 51 kids total so like damn
Aug 18, 2015 6:37pm
Taras Holovko
yeah you should get into whartn
Aug 18, 2015 6:37pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 6:11pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 6:11pm

Aug 18, 2015 6:09pm
Kevin Stephen
i feel like i could be of use to the team
Aug 18, 2015 6:09pm
Kevin Stephen
and i don't want to let the team down
Aug 18, 2015 6:09pm
Taras Holovko
ah okay
Aug 18, 2015 6:08pm
Kevin Stephen
four years
Aug 18, 2015 6:08pm
Taras Holovko
in an non aggressive way
Aug 18, 2015 6:08pm
Kevin Stephen
because i want to be consistent
Aug 18, 2015 6:08pm
Taras Holovko
I say that out of curiosity
Aug 18, 2015 6:08pm
Taras Holovko
why do xc at all then
Aug 18, 2015 6:08pm
Kevin Stephen
just xc
Aug 18, 2015 6:08pm
Kevin Stephen

Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 6:08pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 6:08pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 6:07pm
Kevin Stephen

Aug 18, 2015 6:07pm
Taras Holovko
I did 77 miles last week
Aug 18, 2015 6:07pm
Taras Holovko
yeah makes sense
Aug 18, 2015 6:07pm
Kevin Stephen
so i'm not trying to test fate
Aug 18, 2015 6:06pm
Kevin Stephen
that's what he said will inevitably happen in september or october if i run
Aug 18, 2015 6:06pm
Kevin Stephen
also not trying to tear a ligament
Aug 18, 2015 6:06pm
Taras Holovko
ah ok
Aug 18, 2015 6:06pm
Kevin Stephen
he wrote it on my form so i have no choice
Aug 18, 2015 6:06pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah i have to take this week off
Aug 18, 2015 6:06pm
Kevin Stephen
last week i was looking pretty good -- like probably #6
Aug 18, 2015 6:06pm
Taras Holovko
are you taking the week off then
Aug 18, 2015 6:06pm
Kevin Stephen
but i'm sure i'll still be in good shape on sunday
Aug 18, 2015 6:05pm
Taras Holovko
yeah that blows
Aug 18, 2015 6:05pm
Kevin Stephen
so that sucks
Aug 18, 2015 6:05pm
Kevin Stephen
and he looked at my ankle said i needed to take another week off
Aug 18, 2015 6:05pm
Kevin Stephen
but i went to the doctor for a physical last week
Aug 18, 2015 6:05pm
Kevin Stephen
going well
Aug 18, 2015 6:05pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 6:05pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 6:05pm
Kevin Stephen

Aug 18, 2015 6:04pm
Kevin Stephen
i think he knows what he's doing
Aug 18, 2015 6:04pm
Kevin Stephen
not nearly as strict as salomon
Aug 18, 2015 6:04pm
Kevin Stephen
coach mahoney he's chill
Aug 18, 2015 6:04pm
Taras Holovko
wow hm
Aug 18, 2015 6:04pm
Kevin Stephen
this is james
Aug 18, 2015 6:03pm
Kevin Stephen
but not nearly as much as jack <--> brandon
Aug 18, 2015 6:03pm
Taras Holovko
this is james?
Aug 18, 2015 6:03pm
Kevin Stephen
so there's some tension
Aug 18, 2015 6:03pm
Kevin Stephen
to the point where he brought in his own schedule and tried to make us do that
Aug 18, 2015 6:03pm
Taras Holovko
how is the new coach in general
Aug 18, 2015 6:03pm
Kevin Stephen
and he gets frustrated w the new coach because our workouts aren't fast enough
Aug 18, 2015 6:03pm
Taras Holovko
ah
Aug 18, 2015 6:03pm
Kevin Stephen
so rn he's better than dylan (or at least he was last week)
Aug 18, 2015 6:03pm
Kevin Stephen
apparently james didn't take a break between spring and summer or something like that
Aug 18, 2015 6:02pm
Kevin Stephen
as well as dylan
Aug 18, 2015 6:02pm
Kevin Stephen
friction between james and the coach
Aug 18, 2015 6:02pm
Taras Holovko
how so
Aug 18, 2015 6:02pm
Kevin Stephen
some palpable tension on the cross country team
Aug 18, 2015 6:02pm
Taras Holovko
yeah I cant wait to get back
Aug 18, 2015 6:01pm
Taras Holovko
wow
Aug 18, 2015 6:01pm

Aug 18, 2015 5:59pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 5:59pm
Taras Holovko
and then the water is nearby
Aug 18, 2015 5:58pm
Taras Holovko
basically everyone goes to these things to drink
Aug 18, 2015 5:58pm
Kevin Stephen
oh wow ok
Aug 18, 2015 5:57pm
Taras Holovko
camping ground
Aug 18, 2015 5:57pm

Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 5:57pm
Taras Holovko
I also never want to drink after seeing these idiots and taking care f them for 2 days
Aug 18, 2015 5:57pm
Kevin Stephen
wow
Aug 18, 2015 5:56pm
Taras Holovko
that's why America is so tame to me
Aug 18, 2015 5:55pm
Taras Holovko

Kevin Stephen

Aug 18, 2015 5:54pm
Taras Holovko
my friend group literally doesn't give a fuck about anything
Aug 18, 2015 5:54pm
Taras Holovko
and our whole company just ended up leaving and basically telling him to fuck off
Aug 18, 2015 5:54pm
Taras Holovko
he wanted to get money from us for it
Aug 18, 2015 5:53pm
Taras Holovko
we pierced some guy's mattress
Aug 18, 2015 5:53pm
Taras Holovko
the amount of puke
Aug 18, 2015 5:53pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 5:51pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 18, 2015 5:51pm
Kevin Stephen

Aug 18, 2015 5:42pm
Kevin Stephen

Aug 18, 2015 5:42pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen
Abhishek up to his old games lolol
Aug 15, 2015 8:35am
Kevin Stephen
You sent a photo.

Aug 15, 2015 8:35am
Kevin Stephen
But also keep examples at the end of each topic to reinforce the material
Aug 15, 2015 8:08am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah we can do that. That's a good idea
Aug 15, 2015 8:08am
Taras Holovko
how would you feel if we put an example after each individual portion
Aug 15, 2015 4:14am
Taras Holovko
e.g. this is all clumped
Aug 15, 2015 4:14am
Taras Holovko
Question Type: Singular vs. Plural Rules
Neither and nor with compound subjects always need singular verbs, unless one of the subjects is plural (this exception is not tested on the SAT, so don’t worry about it). 
Collective nouns (team, family, school, country, city) → always singular.
Each & every → singular subjects
“A number of” → plural BUT “The number” → singular
Gerunds used as subjects → Singular
What & Whether as subject → Singular
Aug 15, 2015 4:14am
Taras Holovko
what do you think if we put examples after every individual rule
Aug 15, 2015 4:14am
Taras Holovko
instead of listing 5-6 rules in a chunk and then proceeding to examples
Aug 15, 2015 4:14am
Taras Holovko
biggest change i want to make to the writing strategy
Aug 15, 2015 4:13am
Taras Holovko
4 wk, 6wk, so on

Aug 14, 2015 7:57pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 14, 2015 7:55pm
Taras Holovko

Aug 14, 2015 7:55pm
Taras Holovko
http://www.erikthered.com/tutor/facts-and-formulas-0.pdf
Aug 14, 2015 7:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Be more considerate next time. I apologize for the mean time.
Aug 14, 2015 7:09pm
Kevin Stephen
Alright. Regardless, we both know the value of work - in this case, a doc that has gotten a student to a 780 with little else helping him
Aug 14, 2015 7:08pm
Taras Holovko
Yes I'm at fault in that I didn't update it, but I also had other things to do and I'll do it soon enough
Aug 14, 2015 7:01pm
Taras Holovko
When I said it sucked, I meant it did in the sense that it was missing information - which it is
Aug 14, 2015 7:01pm
Kevin Stephen
I should've given you a bit worse
Aug 14, 2015 6:57pm
Kevin Stephen
For the way you talked to me
Aug 14, 2015 6:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Get over it
Aug 14, 2015 6:57pm
Taras Holovko
"I don't see any new ones"
Aug 14, 2015 6:50pm
Taras Holovko
"You said you were going to add more examples"
Aug 14, 2015 6:50pm
Taras Holovko
Read it
Aug 14, 2015 6:50pm
Taras Holovko
The way you asked
Aug 14, 2015 6:50pm
Taras Holovko
I didn't promise changes
Aug 14, 2015 6:50pm
Kevin Stephen
That's literally the fact of the matter.
Aug 14, 2015 6:49pm
Kevin Stephen
Keep telling you what? You took a doc - which we were both supposed to work on - that I put 6 or 7 hours of work into and you told me it sucked. Then when I asked you two weeks later where your promised changes are, you call me a dick.
Aug 14, 2015 6:49pm
Taras Holovko
And yeah ok keep telling me that
Aug 14, 2015 5:55pm
Taras Holovko
I said it sucks because it's missing important info
Aug 14, 2015 5:54pm
Taras Holovko
That's not what i said
Aug 14, 2015 5:54pm
Kevin Stephen
and yes i agree. i'll make a spread for schools or i think we might already have one
Aug 14, 2015 4:09pm
Kevin Stephen
if you were an employee you'd be fired by your boss
Aug 14, 2015 4:08pm
Kevin Stephen
so don't give me shit about being a dick
Aug 14, 2015 4:08pm
Kevin Stephen
and you told me it sucked and said you'd do better
Aug 14, 2015 4:08pm
Kevin Stephen
after i spent several hours making the writing doc
Aug 14, 2015 4:08pm
Kevin Stephen
i was merely responding to your remark at scholars
Aug 14, 2015 4:07pm
Taras Holovko
And then Im just going to do tutoring until the new SAT comes
Aug 14, 2015 4:03pm
Taras Holovko
We have 1) docs, 2) site, and 3) seminars
Aug 14, 2015 4:03pm
Taras Holovko
But not really of most priority
Aug 14, 2015 4:03pm
Taras Holovko
I'll do it
Aug 14, 2015 4:02pm
Taras Holovko
Yeah Bc I didnt have time
Aug 14, 2015 4:02pm
Kevin Stephen
and then you didn't do anything
Aug 14, 2015 4:02pm
Taras Holovko
If I was any employee and you were my boss I would quit
Aug 14, 2015 4:02pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah dude you were yelling at me for making a shitty writing strategy
Aug 14, 2015 4:02pm
Taras Holovko
This
Aug 14, 2015 4:02pm
Taras Holovko
Taras sent a photo.

Aug 14, 2015 4:02pm
Kevin Stephen

Aug 14, 2015 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen
you took that message in the wrong tone lol
Aug 14, 2015 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm not being a dick
Aug 14, 2015 4:01pm
Taras Holovko
Stop being a dick
Aug 14, 2015 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen
We are not using their theme as well
Aug 12, 2015 8:52pm
Kevin Stephen
We've gotten enough shit for being too similar to the AH website
Aug 12, 2015 8:52pm
Taras Holovko
This isn't worth $30
Aug 12, 2015 2:58pm
Taras Holovko
For a great price
Aug 12, 2015 2:58pm
Taras Holovko
The AH theme is so damn nice lol
Aug 12, 2015 2:58pm
Kevin Stephen
This is just one option
Aug 12, 2015 2:57pm
Kevin Stephen
We'll need to upgrade the site sooner or later
Aug 12, 2015 2:57pm
Kevin Stephen
lol we're not straight up copying AH theme
Aug 12, 2015 2:57pm

Kevin Stephen
Yeah word
Aug 04, 2015 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
this

Aug 04, 2015 6:40pm
Kevin Stephen
This you mean?
Aug 04, 2015 6:40pm
Taras Holovko
better business model then
Aug 04, 2015 6:38pm

She was compiling writing practice Q's this morning
Aug 04, 2015 6:38pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah she's actually excited about it
Aug 04, 2015 6:37pm
Taras Holovko
if you think that's sufficient incentive then that's fine
Aug 04, 2015 6:37pm
Taras Holovko
nothing
Aug 04, 2015 6:37pm
Kevin Stephen
What did you have in mind?
Aug 04, 2015 6:37pm
Taras Holovko
okay
Aug 04, 2015 6:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Same for all the employees
Aug 04, 2015 6:36pm
Taras Holovko
per hour?
Aug 04, 2015 6:36pm
Taras Holovko
we're kicking $10 back to Ila?
Aug 04, 2015 6:36pm
Kevin Stephen
And he just started the Barron's book
Aug 04, 2015 10:22am
Taras Holovko
that's awesome
Aug 04, 2015 10:22am
Kevin Stephen
That five hundred point jump tho
Aug 04, 2015 10:22am
Kevin Stephen
So Devin is now at 2160
Aug 04, 2015 10:22am
Kevin Stephen
i'll be with john henry today
Aug 04, 2015 10:09am
Kevin Stephen
okay do that
Aug 04, 2015 10:08am
Taras Holovko
i have to reach out to him
Aug 04, 2015 10:08am
Kevin Stephen
how about jack roberts
Aug 04, 2015 10:03am
Taras Holovko
Okay that makes sense
Aug 04, 2015 9:35am
Kevin Stephen
That'd be perfect actually
Aug 04, 2015 9:35am
Kevin Stephen
And then an employee profit column
Aug 04, 2015 9:35am
Kevin Stephen
A fee column
Aug 04, 2015 9:35am
Kevin Stephen
Or we could do
Aug 04, 2015 9:35am
Taras Holovko
Yep
Aug 04, 2015 9:33am
Kevin Stephen
But you're right it's probably not necessary
Aug 04, 2015 9:33am
Kevin Stephen
Still there must be a way to do this so we can have sum $$ represented as well
Aug 04, 2015 9:31am
Taras Holovko
yeah
Aug 04, 2015 9:30am
Kevin Stephen
I thought so? But wait that doesn't work because Ila Shagun Keera and rushil
Aug 04, 2015 9:30am
Taras Holovko
We can only donate as much as we individually earn?
Aug 04, 2015 9:29am
Kevin Stephen
I'll reformat it and show you what I mean
Aug 04, 2015 9:29am
Kevin Stephen
It does tho bc otherwise how do we know how much we can donate to our charities
Aug 04, 2015 9:29am
Taras Holovko
I don't think money should matter too much per person
Aug 04, 2015 9:27am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah so just one list for hours and then multiple for the money
Aug 04, 2015 9:25am
Taras Holovko
Just sum it
Aug 04, 2015 9:25am
Kevin Stephen
Oh I think ik what you're saying
Aug 04, 2015 9:25am
Taras Holovko
There are columns that list the hour for each of us
Aug 04, 2015 9:25am
Kevin Stephen
What do you mean
Aug 04, 2015 9:24am
Taras Holovko
Have it run the column with hours instead
Aug 04, 2015 9:24am
Kevin Stephen
And whatever is after 20 goes to the employee
Aug 04, 2015 9:24am
Taras Holovko
Oh yeah
Aug 04, 2015 9:24am
Kevin Stephen
Because some is 20, some 30
Aug 04, 2015 9:23am
Taras Holovko
What do you mean
Aug 04, 2015 9:23am
Kevin Stephen
We'll have to reformat the time sheet
Aug 04, 2015 9:23am
Kevin Stephen
I think because of the payment restructuring f
Aug 04, 2015 9:23am
Kevin Stephen
Yep it is
Aug 04, 2015 9:23am
Taras Holovko
Just have to make sure spreadsheet is up to date
Aug 04, 2015 9:22am
Taras Holovko
Ok that's fine
Aug 04, 2015 9:22am
Kevin Stephen
I'll ask Ila when the next one is scheduled for
Aug 04, 2015 9:22am
Kevin Stephen

Nevertheless, CollegeBoard’s guessing penalty (-¼ of a point for incorrect guesses) essentially means that you are statistically likely to evenly compensate for your incorrect guesses if you can eliminate at least one choice per question, and that you will gain points by guessing (as opposed to omitting) if you can eliminate more than one choice per question.
Jun 17, 2015 1:31pm

Archetype ***
Jun 15, 2015 6:17pm
Taras Holovko
In that it broke my perception of the southern scene type
Jun 15, 2015 6:17pm
Taras Holovko
It was a very enlightening experience
Jun 15, 2015 6:17pm
Kevin Stephen
you could be conservative and do that
Jun 15, 2015 6:17pm
Taras Holovko
His freestyle was mind blowing

Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm
Taras Holovko
Like this kid from Texas
Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm
Kevin Stephen
lolol
Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm
Taras Holovko
There were maybe 5 true conservatives out of 37
Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm

Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm
Taras Holovko
At Govcon
Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah
Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm
Taras Holovko
Like you have no idea
Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm
Kevin Stephen
more liberal presidents would be elected
Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm
Taras Holovko
Then many formerly republican states would become democratic
Jun 15, 2015 6:16pm
Taras Holovko
I think if more young voters were active
Jun 15, 2015 6:15pm
Taras Holovko
And funded by sanders
Jun 15, 2015 6:14pm
Taras Holovko
Maybe it's rigged
Jun 15, 2015 6:14pm
Kevin Stephen
kevin liu got 90% ted cruz so idk the validity of the quiz is questionable
Jun 15, 2015 6:14pm
Kevin Stephen
maybe it's inaccurate
Jun 15, 2015 6:14pm
Kevin Stephen
perhaps he's less liberal than we thought
Jun 15, 2015 6:14pm
Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Taras Holovko

Jun 07, 2015 6:59pm
Taras Holovko
It was replaced w plate
Jun 07, 2015 6:59pm

Or repulsion?
Jun 07, 2015 6:59pm

Was attraction
Jun 07, 2015 6:58pm

Taras Holovko
1. A (acceleration and net force - both negative)
2. A (acceleration and net force - both negative)
3. A (acceleration and net force - both negative)
4. Two stationary net charges - no points had 0 force
5. Two stationary net charges - outside points on x-axis deflected to the right
6. Standing waves - highest amplitude (obvious)
7. Standing waves - lowest frequency (top one of this picture http://img.ultimate-guitar.com/_img/columns/zeg/3-4-1.jpg)
8. Standing waves - largest wavelength (top one of this picture http://img.ultimate-guitar.com/_img/columns/zeg/3-4-1.jpg)
9. Charged particle repelled from wire (3 question set)
10. Two wires with current in same direction attract (3 question set)
11. Charge deflected parallel (3 question set)
12. Largest change in momentum = straight line graph with largest area under curve
13. asteroid would appear to have the greatest length to 0.1c
14. Galileo didnt discover expanding universe
15. Superconductivity = low temperature electronic devices
16. Light bulb only gave off radiation
17. Convex mirror produced the virtual image (image was behind mirror and smaller)
18. Image formed at 15 cm on other side of convex lens.
19. Image of child was 10.5m from adult (real adult not image)
20. If the switch were closed the bulb NOT in the parallel would have the greatest current
21. The consensus is that all 3 brightness would change if the switch would close --> however i disagree and only the ones in the parallel would change (see my post #67)
22. Curved acceleration-time graph - increasing speed until constant speed
23. Resistors are affected by length, area, and temperature
24. Change in internal energy = -12J
25. Total kinetic energy of ball being dropped = 120J
26. question 74: direction cannot be found because magnetic field direction is not known
27. last question: alternating loud, soft (changing intensity)
28. average speed of the snail 2m/hr
29. magnitude of electric field = V/d
30. slope of graph = .33ohms
31. 16 decays per second
32 None of the above affected radioactivity of an element
33. Atom loses energy when emitting photon
34. amount of time doesnt affect the heat i think Q=mc(delta)T
35. smaller hole and larger wavelength would make single slit diffraction larger
36. time objects were in contact 0.1s
37. the force on object makes it go in a circle
38. linear expansion? 10.006
39. photon has no mass
40. i remember getting 36 photons as an answer somewhere
41. doppler effect = two objects moving relative to each other
42 inducing electric field moving the coil and wire
43. increasing speed equals increased kinetic energy (pendulum)
44. force acting against pendulum = decreased kinetic energy, increased potential energy?
45. voltmeter connected in parallel, ammeter connected in series
