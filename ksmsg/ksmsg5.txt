Jul 01, 2018 3:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
whether on a state or federal level
Jul 01, 2018 3:25pm

any laws created to enforce that will merely exacerbate the problem

Sophia Chirayil
just don‚Äôt think there should be forced shut downs of clinics
Jul 01, 2018 3:24pm

üòçKevin Stephen
Jun 05, 2018 5:20am
Sophia Chirayil
i think i will make myself go insane
May 31, 2018 5:17pm
Sophia Chirayil
to know what the truth is
May 31, 2018 5:17pm
Sophia Chirayil
it is just sometimes very hard
May 31, 2018 5:17pm
Sophia Chirayil
no that‚Äôs okay
May 31, 2018 5:10pm
Kevin Stephen
But this is my perspective on all this
May 31, 2018 5:08pm
Kevin Stephen
I don‚Äôt mean to moralize I‚Äôm sorry
May 31, 2018 5:08pm
Kevin Stephen
Truly we‚Äôre just images of God so if God is love, ergo our true selves are those which reflect his love
May 31, 2018 5:07pm
Kevin Stephen
But that‚Äôs what true self is I think
May 31, 2018 5:06pm
Kevin Stephen
I don‚Äôt know if I could ever live like that
May 31, 2018 5:06pm
Kevin Stephen
Lives a life of complete self sacrifice
May 31, 2018 5:06pm
Kevin Stephen
Today he‚Äôs flying back with me to New York and then Florida for Rajeev chettan‚Äôs ordination
May 31, 2018 5:06pm
Kevin Stephen
For a family funeral
May 31, 2018 5:06pm
Kevin Stephen
Pithavu flew here three days ago after Vileena Chechi‚Äôs wedding
May 31, 2018 5:06pm
Kevin Stephen
God‚Äôs plan
May 31, 2018 5:05pm
Kevin Stephen
I don‚Äôt think I individually am worth that much but I think if I can use my life to impact a lot of people in a really positive way and change the world then I will have fulfilled
May 31, 2018 5:05pm
Kevin Stephen
I believe that
May 31, 2018 5:04pm
Kevin Stephen
To impact the world
May 31, 2018 5:04pm
Kevin Stephen
He would‚Äôve said the best thing we can do is to be of service to others
May 31, 2018 5:04pm
Kevin Stephen
That‚Äôs actually in opposition to what Christ taught and there you‚Äôre right
May 31, 2018 5:03pm
Kevin Stephen
The emphasis of self expression and individual above all else characterizes our generation more than any other
May 31, 2018 5:02pm
Sophia Chirayil
go on
May 31, 2018 5:01pm
Kevin Stephen
Oo this is the true post modern mindset
May 31, 2018 5:01pm
Sophia Chirayil
and i don‚Äôt think i can do that if i try to be the perfect Catholic
May 31, 2018 5:01pm
Sophia Chirayil
i want to freely be me
May 31, 2018 5:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
and i don‚Äôt like that
May 31, 2018 5:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
has been a suppression of my truest self
May 31, 2018 5:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
trying to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù
May 31, 2018 5:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
i feel that for some reason
May 31, 2018 5:00pm
Kevin Stephen
The purest kind
May 31, 2018 5:00pm
Kevin Stephen
I‚Äôm a complete idealist
May 31, 2018 4:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
but anyhoo
May 31, 2018 4:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
i‚Äôve never read you as an idealist
May 31, 2018 4:59pm
Kevin Stephen
So nothing I say should be taken at face value
May 31, 2018 4:59pm
Kevin Stephen
I also tend to have very positive opinions of people until they wrong me haha
May 31, 2018 4:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Well everyone I‚Äôve met here
May 31, 2018 4:58pm
Sophia Chirayil
idk
May 31, 2018 4:58pm
Sophia Chirayil
are they really though
May 31, 2018 4:58pm
Kevin Stephen
People here in Kerala are openminded, modern, and kind
May 31, 2018 4:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
lmaoo
May 31, 2018 4:57pm
Kevin Stephen
I do think that though
May 31, 2018 4:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahahaha
May 31, 2018 4:57pm
Kevin Stephen
‚ÄúTheir skin is dark but their hearts are white‚Äù were his words
May 31, 2018 4:57pm
Kevin Stephen
The most openminded people in India
May 31, 2018 4:57pm
Kevin Stephen
He said ah I love malayalees
May 31, 2018 4:56pm
Kevin Stephen
He asked me where I‚Äôm from in India so I said Kerala
May 31, 2018 4:56pm
Kevin Stephen
When I was in Delhi I was asking this uncle on the road for directions
May 31, 2018 4:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha we have all the time in the world to think!
May 31, 2018 4:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
i think imma have to do more thinking
May 31, 2018 4:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
huh
May 31, 2018 4:55pm
Kevin Stephen
But I do think the bar for goodness is much higher than most people think
May 31, 2018 4:54pm
Kevin Stephen
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs mind control
May 31, 2018 4:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
hmm ok that makes sense
May 31, 2018 4:52pm
Kevin Stephen
Every moral situation I‚Äôm faced with almost can be boiled down to that question
May 31, 2018 4:52pm
Kevin Stephen
And it doesn‚Äôt show love for the other person
May 31, 2018 4:51pm
Kevin Stephen
But it‚Äôs selfish and condescending too
May 31, 2018 4:51pm
Kevin Stephen
The first is in my self interest
May 31, 2018 4:51pm
Kevin Stephen
So when I‚Äôm talking at CBE board meetings I can either lash out at people who don‚Äôt do their shit or I can empathize and try to understand
May 31, 2018 4:51pm
Kevin Stephen
And I‚Äôm generally an impatient person
May 31, 2018 4:50pm
Kevin Stephen
I get frustrated easily when I work with people who don‚Äôt work that hard
May 31, 2018 4:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes sure
May 31, 2018 4:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
can you give me a concrete example
May 31, 2018 4:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
this is kinda hard to digest
May 31, 2018 4:45pm
Kevin Stephen
which is why they‚Äôre sin in the first place

But all those things are just rejecting God‚Äôs love and his plan
May 31, 2018 4:42pm
Kevin Stephen
So I do see sin as a real force that I have to actively and continuously wrestle with in order to achieve greater love for God and others
May 31, 2018 4:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Whether that‚Äôs in pride or selfishness or greed or vanity or lust or just lying to make myself look better
May 31, 2018 4:40pm
Kevin Stephen
And when I think of myself instead, that‚Äôs when I sin
May 31, 2018 4:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Usually when I‚Äôm in situations there‚Äôs one choice that‚Äôs in my own interests, and one that actually shows love for God or other
May 31, 2018 4:39pm
Kevin Stephen
And the Ten Commandments flow pretty well from the Love God, love one another commandments
May 31, 2018 4:39pm
Kevin Stephen
God is love
May 31, 2018 4:38pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm I think the way I see it
May 31, 2018 4:38pm
Kevin Stephen

Sophia Chirayil

üòÆKevin Stephen
May 31, 2018 4:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Most of the time I‚Äôve found that there‚Äôs an objectively right thing to do and I pick the wrong thing anyway
May 31, 2018 4:30pm
Kevin Stephen
My experience and perspective has been completely different
May 31, 2018 4:30pm
Kevin Stephen
Oo interesting
May 31, 2018 4:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
but most of the time it is gray and very subjective
May 31, 2018 4:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
ok like i think there is a morally ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to do in most situations
May 31, 2018 4:27pm
Sophia Chirayil
yea sorry
May 31, 2018 4:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
and a form of mind control
May 31, 2018 4:26pm
Kevin Stephen
üòÆ
May 31, 2018 4:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
i think the concept of sin is kind of bullshit
May 31, 2018 4:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
i don‚Äôt want you to think i‚Äôm off the rails or a crazy radical
May 31, 2018 4:25pm

Aug 02, 2017 11:07am
Sophia Chirayil

Aug 02, 2017 11:07am
Sophia Chirayil

Aug 02, 2017 11:06am

Aug 02, 2017 11:03am
Kevin Stephen
What the heck
Aug 02, 2017 11:03am
Sophia Chirayil
idk i just don't understand why i have weird/scary dreams about retreats
Aug 02, 2017 9:55am
Sophia Chirayil
and she tells me in the dream that she had an abortion in college so she feels like this is her penance or something
Aug 02, 2017 9:55am
Sophia Chirayil
including VARSHA
Aug 02, 2017 9:53am
Sophia Chirayil
and all these girls are volunteering
Aug 02, 2017 9:53am
Sophia Chirayil
bc ofc i don't want to deliver a freaking baby
Aug 02, 2017 9:53am
Sophia Chirayil
so im in the retreat getting freaked out by all of this
Aug 02, 2017 9:53am
Sophia Chirayil
they explained it as reversing the damage the abortion had done
Aug 02, 2017 9:52am
Sophia Chirayil
basically if you got stamped on the stomach by this machine you would deliver a baby within 2 hours
Aug 02, 2017 9:52am
Sophia Chirayil
but this time they gave the option to every girl there to get "stamped on the stomach"
Aug 02, 2017 9:51am
Sophia Chirayil
oh yea ok it was another retreat one
Aug 02, 2017 9:50am

Jul 31, 2017 6:53pm
Kevin Stephen
But in places like Japan and Taiwan it's also a bit of sexism I'm sure
Jul 31, 2017 5:34pm
Kevin Stephen
We have the name recognition just because we've been around so long and have worked hard to cultivate those kind of relationships
Jul 31, 2017 5:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Mostly history
Jul 31, 2017 5:33pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 29, 2017 10:45am

Jul 29, 2017 10:43am

Jul 29, 2017 10:42am

Jul 12, 2017 3:09am
Kevin Stephen
My face isn't square
Jul 12, 2017 3:09am
Sophia Chirayil
yours is square so you need hair volume
Jul 12, 2017 3:08am
Kevin Stephen
Do u have any idea how hard that hair is to maintain!
Jul 12, 2017 3:08am
Sophia Chirayil
RYAN FACE IS MORE OVAL THAN URS
Jul 12, 2017 3:08am
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2017 6:00am
Sophia Chirayil
okay
Jul 11, 2017 6:00am
Kevin Stephen
So what I would do is de-escalate with Ben and talk to him about the whole thing if it ever reaches a critical mass
Jul 11, 2017 5:28am
Kevin Stephen
Even though it might be good for you as a growing individual, hiding things from your parents will harm your relationship with them and that's crucial at this point in our lives
Jul 11, 2017 5:27am
Kevin Stephen
If you don't feel comfortable talking with your parents about a serious relationship then that means you're likely not ready for a serious relationship
Jul 11, 2017 5:27am
Kevin Stephen
Here this is what I really think
Jul 11, 2017 5:26am
Kevin Stephen
Sorry for laughing at your expense
Jul 11, 2017 5:22am
Kevin Stephen
I just didn't think you were actually concerned about this
Jul 11, 2017 5:22am
Kevin Stephen
No no im sorry
Jul 11, 2017 5:22am
Sophia Chirayil
anyways i thought talking to u would help but ur just making fun of this whole thing
Jul 11, 2017 5:14am
Sophia Chirayil
im so impatient it's hard for me to just take things as they come
Jul 11, 2017 5:03am
Sophia Chirayil
i think too far ahead it's a problem of mine
Jul 11, 2017 5:02am
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2017 5:02am
Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2017 5:01am
Kevin Stephen

Jul 11, 2017 5:01am
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2017 5:01am
Kevin Stephen
If it weren't you wouldn't be having this conversation w me
Jul 11, 2017 5:01am
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2017 5:01am
Kevin Stephen
Is it because it's getting serious
Jul 11, 2017 5:01am
Sophia Chirayil
i just don't want my mom to explode on me
Jul 11, 2017 5:01am
Kevin Stephen

Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil
how did u tell your parents about brittany
Jul 11, 2017 4:50am
Kevin Stephen
But that was easy bc I just told them I asked a girl to formal
Jul 11, 2017 4:49am
Kevin Stephen
Which is actually all that happened
Jul 11, 2017 4:49am
Kevin Stephen
I told my parents about Atheena but I never mentioned anything other than that I asked her to formal
Jul 11, 2017 4:49am
Kevin Stephen
Talk to them when they're in a good mood
Jul 11, 2017 4:49am
Sophia Chirayil
hiding things is too exhausting
Jul 11, 2017 4:49am
Kevin Stephen
Well there are strategies I'm sure
Jul 11, 2017 4:49am
Sophia Chirayil
if i do start dating Ben idk how i'd tell my parents
Jul 11, 2017 4:48am
Sophia Chirayil
oh ok
Jul 11, 2017 4:46am
Kevin Stephen
It's also good that I discovered early that she's just an awkward person hahaha
Jul 11, 2017 4:46am
Kevin Stephen
No I was never in it to date atheena
Jul 11, 2017 4:46am

Jul 11, 2017 4:45am
Kevin Stephen
But I guess if i did and it was serious then I would tell them
Jul 11, 2017 4:45am
Kevin Stephen
I also don't think I would date a non Syro girl
Jul 11, 2017 4:45am
Kevin Stephen
I probably wouldn't start dating a girl in college is my answer

Kevin Stephen

Jun 30, 2017 7:49am
Sophia Chirayil
okay
Jun 30, 2017 7:49am
Kevin Stephen
Yes absolutely
Jun 30, 2017 7:47am
Sophia Chirayil
i think i need to distract myself a bit first instead of just thinking about it for too long
Jun 30, 2017 7:46am
Sophia Chirayil
haha tru
Jun 30, 2017 7:45am
Kevin Stephen
You listen to all my stupid stories!
Jun 30, 2017 7:45am
Kevin Stephen
No of course I'm here to listen
Jun 30, 2017 7:45am
Sophia Chirayil
but thank you for listening
Jun 30, 2017 7:45am
Sophia Chirayil
ugh
Jun 30, 2017 7:44am
Sophia Chirayil
and on my neck too
Jun 30, 2017 7:44am
Sophia Chirayil
well kinda multiple
Jun 30, 2017 7:43am
Kevin Stephen
Was it just a kiss?
Jun 30, 2017 7:43am
Kevin Stephen
Yes that's really sad I'm very sorry you feel like that
Jun 30, 2017 7:43am
Sophia Chirayil
but i will think about it more
Jun 30, 2017 7:43am
Sophia Chirayil
and i just feel so cringey
Jun 30, 2017 7:43am
Sophia Chirayil
to the point that it was actually repulsive
Jun 30, 2017 7:42am
Sophia Chirayil
i think im just sad that it was so meaningless to me
Jun 30, 2017 7:42am
Kevin Stephen
That might help you feel better
Jun 30, 2017 7:40am
Kevin Stephen
But after some time you might just want to think about distilling how much of that guilt is based on your personal feelings and how much of it is based on your morals
Jun 30, 2017 7:40am
Kevin Stephen
And that's completely understandable to feel
Jun 30, 2017 7:39am
Kevin Stephen
No no I completely understand
Jun 30, 2017 7:39am
Sophia Chirayil
i hate everything
Jun 30, 2017 7:33am
Sophia Chirayil

Jun 30, 2017 7:32am
Sophia Chirayil
i feel like if i told him now it'd kinda be out of nowhere
Jun 30, 2017 7:29am
Sophia Chirayil
yea we aren't serious atm
Jun 30, 2017 7:29am
Kevin Stephen
On the other hand if you're not serious and you tell him something like that then that makes things more serious
Jun 30, 2017 7:28am
Kevin Stephen
No that's not bad if you're not serious
Jun 30, 2017 7:28am
Sophia Chirayil

Jun 30, 2017 7:21am
Sophia Chirayil
i dont think now would be a good time

Kevin Stephen

Jun 29, 2017 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
If the guy just went for it then it's not your fault
Jun 29, 2017 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm really sorry that your first kiss wasn't with someone that you weren't in love with but
Jun 29, 2017 9:32pm

gud job
Feb 17, 2017 1:02am

but i accidentally requested to be matched with guys
Feb 17, 2017 1:02am

which is basically a matching algorithm that sets you up with people that you're compatible with

or if it was always forgivable by priests while abortion wasn't then idek nothing makes sense
Jan 25, 2017 12:29am
Sophia Chirayil
but if murder is not forgivable by priests, then clearly something is up
Jan 25, 2017 12:25am
Sophia Chirayil
the church's stance hasn't changed
Jan 25, 2017 12:25am
Sophia Chirayil
well facilitating forgiveness should not downplay the gravity of a sin
Jan 25, 2017 12:25am
Kevin Stephen
maybe not
Jan 25, 2017 12:23am
Kevin Stephen
i thought so
Jan 25, 2017 12:23am
Sophia Chirayil
can it?
Jan 25, 2017 12:22am
Kevin Stephen
no right bc murder can also be forgiven by priests too
Jan 25, 2017 12:22am
Kevin Stephen
but does that imply that unborn fetuses are less valued as humans than regular people
Jan 25, 2017 12:22am
Kevin Stephen
that's a good point
Jan 25, 2017 12:21am
Kevin Stephen
yes i did hear about that
Jan 25, 2017 12:21am
Sophia Chirayil
the pope recently made it so that abortions can now be forgiven by priests
Jan 25, 2017 12:20am
Sophia Chirayil
anyways my point is abortion is a mortal sin but maybe it is a mortal sin to a lesser extent than killing someone
Jan 25, 2017 12:19am
Sophia Chirayil
like there are cases where it's an addiction for a person in which case it would be more of a venial sin since it's harder to control
Jan 25, 2017 12:16am
Sophia Chirayil
yea u right
Jan 25, 2017 12:16am
Kevin Stephen
Sin
Jan 25, 2017 12:15am
Kevin Stephen
Yes although I've read conflicting literature about masturbation being a mortal vs venial son
Jan 25, 2017 12:15am
Sophia Chirayil
for example both pre-marital sex and masturbation are considered mortal sins by the Catholic church, but masturbation to a lesser extent because it doesn't involve another person
Jan 25, 2017 12:14am
Sophia Chirayil
like yea you have mortal sin vs. venial sin but there are varying degrees of each
Jan 25, 2017 12:12am
Sophia Chirayil
the gravity of sin is a spectrum
Jan 25, 2017 12:12am
Sophia Chirayil
i have another thought
Jan 25, 2017 12:12am
Sophia Chirayil
thank you
Jan 24, 2017 11:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
ok
Jan 24, 2017 11:52pm
Kevin Stephen
ok well what i will say is that you should really think about whether there's room for moral subjectivity on a life issue like abortion (or euthanasia, capital punishment, and the like). My understanding (and catholic teaching) is that these are objective evils that can't be debated from a freedom-of-choice perspective. A departure from that belief is a serious break with some essential catholic doctrine.
Jan 24, 2017 11:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
ive gotten a clearer understanding through this conversation tho so thx for that
Jan 24, 2017 11:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
im not even sure what my opinion is
Jan 24, 2017 11:41pm
Kevin Stephen
so currently i'm not even sure what your opinion is so anything i say is moot
Jan 24, 2017 11:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
im hearing you out to try and figure things out that's all
Jan 24, 2017 11:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
im confused
Jan 24, 2017 11:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
that "subjective morality of life" is still something im trying to wrap my head around
Jan 24, 2017 11:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
u know what i also said
Jan 24, 2017 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
"but i do think there is a difference between an embryo and a real live baby"
Jan 24, 2017 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen
well you just said
Jan 24, 2017 11:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
bc it's "invisible" as u said
Jan 24, 2017 11:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
i don't think there's a moral difference; it's just that the way it's characterized makes it seem like there is
Jan 24, 2017 11:33pm
Kevin Stephen
man dude if you really think there's a moral difference between ending a prenatal life and a post-birth life then they've really gotten to you with the rhetoric
Jan 24, 2017 11:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
intentions could be different to an extent
Jan 24, 2017 11:28pm
Kevin Stephen
Well no--the outcome in both cases is the ending of a life and your intention in both cases, all things considered, is to end a life
Jan 24, 2017 11:28pm
Sophia Chirayil
i think that's arguable
Jan 24, 2017 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Sure but the outcome is the same and your intention is the same
Jan 24, 2017 11:27pm
Sophia Chirayil
pain inflicted could be a factor for murder; stabbing someone to death is more vicious than shooting them...like if your intent is to make the victim feel pain and suffer i think that makes it worse
Jan 24, 2017 11:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
but that is for prenatal
Jan 24, 2017 11:23pm
Sophia Chirayil
i think it depends on development
Jan 24, 2017 11:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Like here Soph the real reason we dont care about abortion is because it's invisible. It's painless and convenient in that it allows us to live lives of sexual freedom and economic opportunity
Jan 24, 2017 9:24pm
Kevin Stephen
This would be like saying it's not as bad if you kill someone with a sedated injection as if you shoot them
Jan 24, 2017 9:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Or how developed/autonomous the life is
Jan 24, 2017 9:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Is the culpability of murder assigned based on how much harm you inflict
Jan 24, 2017 9:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Well u tell me
Jan 24, 2017 9:21pm
Sophia Chirayil
like my question really is if abortion = "murder" or should it be seen as just destruction of a smaller form of life
Jan 24, 2017 7:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
or is everything subjective

is there even a moral scale
Jan 24, 2017 6:58pm
Sophia Chirayil
so then can you say that having an abortion is less of a sin than killing a baby/human...that's the part i don't understand
Jan 24, 2017 6:57pm
Kevin Stephen
There are so many confounding variables that make this post absurd

One feels pain when you harm it and the other, depending on what stage in the pregnancy it's at, does not
Jan 24, 2017 6:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Well of course there's a difference between an embryo and a baby
Jan 24, 2017 6:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
but then again the fact that i feel there's a difference might just be a cultural illusion
Jan 24, 2017 6:34pm
Sophia Chirayil
also just wondering what you mean by change of tone
Jan 24, 2017 6:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
but i think u get what im saying
Jan 24, 2017 6:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
that was bad wording
Jan 24, 2017 6:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
but i do think there is a difference between an embryo and a real live baby
Jan 24, 2017 6:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
i still believe that conception is where life begins
Jan 24, 2017 6:29pm

and yea we can easily brush it off as one of those stupid things ppl just share but it actually kind of made me think differently

Jan 24, 2017 6:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
well tbh "subjective morality of life" is still something im trying to wrap my head around
Jan 24, 2017 6:25pm
Kevin Stephen
2 You're absolutely right that if we overturn Roe v Wade and let states decide whether or not to allow abortion or illegalize it as a whole, that will come with a whole host of problems, the greatest of which might be illegal abortions and the danger that causes to the mother. but that's obviously not the solution long term. i think what would actually work ideally is phasing out abortion as a legal institution over time--say starting with a 20-week ban on abortion. but the government has to take a stance that both opposes abortion and makes it possible for women to not be in that situation
Jan 24, 2017 1:10pm
Kevin Stephen
1 being opposed to an abortion ban because of illegal abortions is very different than being opposed to an abortion ban because of a belief in subjective morality on life. it's important to note the huge change of tone between your first and second set of messages on this
Jan 24, 2017 11:53am
Kevin Stephen
ok so a couple things
Jan 24, 2017 11:51am
Sophia Chirayil
we have to kill the roots first, then the plant will die
Jan 24, 2017 3:34am
Sophia Chirayil
banning abortion right now would not solve anything because all the factors that led up to the legalization of abortion and how it is so normalized in society today would still be present
Jan 24, 2017 3:32am
Sophia Chirayil
however changing societal norms is incredibly difficult and will probably take hundreds of years
Jan 24, 2017 3:29am
Sophia Chirayil
i hope one day there will be no need for abortions which may seem impossible, but may be plausible if like i mentioned before we find a way to change the societal norms regarding women/pregnancy in this country
Jan 24, 2017 3:27am
Sophia Chirayil
i too believe that life begins at conception and that abortion is a form of homicide, but if you think banning abortion anytime soon is the right move, you are very very wrong. it will only create more issues. people will continue to get abortions except it will be done illegally and unsafely and will put more lives at risk.
Jan 24, 2017 3:22am
Kevin Stephen
But essentially what you're also pushing here in the latter half of your message is a logically flawed pro-choice stance on abortion--the reason being that human life isn't a subjective reality and isn't subject to the same subjective moral reasoning that can be applied to issues like gay marriage, divorce, or even marijuana legalization. I don't "believe" that life begins at conception--I know it to be a scientific and medical reality. You don't need a TOB lecture for that--just consult a medical textbook. It logically follows that abortion ends a human life. So giving people "the option of abortion"--even understanding how tough pregnancy is in brutal economic circumstances--is exactly like legalizing homicide because not everyone believes that murder is morally objectionable, or the northern antebellum "do-nothing" stance on slavery that argued that we should allow slavery in southern states because southerners had different moral stances on slavery.
Jan 23, 2017 4:44pm
Kevin Stephen
You're right I agree that maternity leave/unemployment/welfare/adoption/contraception programs in this country are completely inadequate and make the pregnancy process much more difficult than it should be for women in tough economic or social circumstances--especially at a time when half of American pregnancies are unplanned. We can't fix the problem of abortion without also fixing healthcare laws, maternity leave laws (look at Sweden--you can take 10 months to a year of mat. leave with 98% of your pay retained).
Jan 23, 2017 4:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
I thought about this for a while before responding. For sure it is unfair and terrible that new wave was kicked out of the march. ofc you can be both pro-life and feminist. Feminism is hella complicated. It is not one size fits all. A fucked up thing about society is that getting pregnant is viewed as a burden and not a natural part of life. Esp in this country, maternity leave programs are absolute shit. This so called ‚Äúchoice‚Äù ends up not even being a choice for a lot of women because of their circumstances. Poor women especially are forced to pick abortion bc if they had the baby, their lives would literally fall apart (for example, a woman who has to work multiple jobs to support herself, all of which don‚Äôt provide paid maternity leave, and btw most companies in the U.S. don‚Äôt). If a woman gets pregnant at an ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù time for her career, the cultural norm tells us to have an abortion, because a pregnancy is seen as a SETBACK in a woman‚Äôs career and not a natural stage of life. Concerning the actual availability of abortions in general though, I also think it is unfair to force one perspective on everyone else. Christians may believe that life begins at conception but not everyone does, so it is unfair to take away the option of abortion from everyone. There are a lot of things that are seen as immoral by some and moral by others, but still exist as options for everyone. Each person chooses their actions according to their own morals. Relating back to the march, one thought to entertain maybe is that if new wave feminists were present at the march, it could have made pro-choice people extremely uncomfortable; (for example, there may be women at the march who have had an abortion in the past and for the majority of them, it was probably a hard, even painful decision to make). A common form of propaganda pro-lifers use are images of mangled, bloody, baby parts. Im not saying that this is exactly what new wave would do, but it could have been a possibility. Any kind of pro-life propaganda is something that could be very difficult and upsetting for a woman who had an abortion in the past to see. In no way am I saying that this is justification for new wave getting kicked out, it‚Äôs just something to think about bc we gotta look at both sides here and if you consider it from the pro-choice side, that is a valid reason to be afraid. However, people have the right to express their beliefs, even if it makes others uncomfortable, so yes I do think new wave should have been included in the march. Making people uncomfortable is even good. ‚ÄúWhite feminism‚Äù is still the mainstream form of feminism and it kicks women of color/immigrants, Muslim women, lesbian/bi/queer/trans women, & women with disabilities to the curb. When Black women bring the #blacklivesmatter movement into the feminist movement, it tends to make some white women really uncomfortable, but awareness starts with being uncomfortable. As you can see there is no clear answer here. There so many factors that brought us to this point and many of them are so deeply ingrained societally/culturally and in our minds, like the stigma surrounding pregnancy and what it means to be a successful woman in modern America. We have to tackle the root issues first instead of pointing fingers.
Jan 23, 2017 2:10am
Kevin Stephen
this is sad. the alienation of pro-life women from the march--and from mainstream contemporary feminism as a whole--is intolerant and frustrating

Sophia Chirayil
yea lots of legacies here
Aug 25, 2016 1:00am
Kevin Stephen
which i'm glad about
Aug 25, 2016 1:00am
Kevin Stephen
but much less than back home
Aug 25, 2016 1:00am
Kevin Stephen
oh yeah i've seen a few of those kids here
Aug 25, 2016 1:00am
Sophia Chirayil
some of the kids here behave just like the jocks in high school who didn't care about academics
Aug 25, 2016 1:00am
Kevin Stephen
and then athletes, affirmative action, legacies
Aug 25, 2016 1:00am
Kevin Stephen
i've noticed that today
Aug 25, 2016 12:59am
Sophia Chirayil
true
Aug 25, 2016 12:59am
Kevin Stephen
but when we in NJ think of a "Harvard kid", we're thinking of someone at a much higher level than the same standard in kansas or oklahoma
Aug 25, 2016 12:59am
Sophia Chirayil
but i thought harvard would be like hella geniuses
Aug 25, 2016 12:59am
Sophia Chirayil
well yea i experienced the same thing here
Aug 25, 2016 12:59am
Kevin Stephen
they're smart of course
Aug 25, 2016 12:59am
Kevin Stephen
yeah like
Aug 25, 2016 12:59am
Sophia Chirayil
really?
Aug 25, 2016 12:59am
Kevin Stephen
hm interesting
Aug 25, 2016 12:58am
Sophia Chirayil
and like not very approachable
Aug 25, 2016 12:58am
Kevin Stephen
people here really aren't as smart as i expected
Aug 25, 2016 12:58am
Kevin Stephen
right
Aug 25, 2016 12:58am
Sophia Chirayil
they aren't aware of their privilege
Aug 25, 2016 12:58am
Kevin Stephen
ohh okay
Aug 25, 2016 12:58am
Sophia Chirayil
so predominantly wealthy white communities
Aug 25, 2016 12:58am
Sophia Chirayil
close minded as in a lot of the kids here went to southern public schools
Aug 25, 2016 12:58am
Kevin Stephen
this is also liberal new england
Aug 25, 2016 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
everyone here seems really open
Aug 25, 2016 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
the second half was much more serious
Aug 25, 2016 12:57am
Sophia Chirayil
ok
Aug 25, 2016 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
the first half was really cringeworthy and funny
Aug 25, 2016 12:57am
Sophia Chirayil
ohhh
Aug 25, 2016 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
so they talked about different approaches to sex and making sure to get consent
Aug 25, 2016 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
yeah bc it was about consent right
Aug 25, 2016 12:56am
Sophia Chirayil
comical?
Aug 25, 2016 12:56am
Kevin Stephen
close-minded how so?
Aug 25, 2016 12:56am
Kevin Stephen
because half of it was just about sex
Aug 25, 2016 12:56am
Sophia Chirayil
and the alcohol/drugs one
Aug 25, 2016 12:56am
Kevin Stephen
and there was so much like comical graphic detail
Aug 25, 2016 12:56am
Sophia Chirayil
ya we had those too
Aug 25, 2016 12:56am
Kevin Stephen
like we had a sexual assault seminar today
Aug 25, 2016 12:55am
Sophia Chirayil
i feel like some ppl here are kinda close minded
Aug 25, 2016 12:55am
Sophia Chirayil
yea
Aug 25, 2016 12:55am
Sophia Chirayil
one of my profs is dean of undergraduate studies
Aug 25, 2016 12:55am
Kevin Stephen
it's an interesting shift from catholic school to harvard
Aug 25, 2016 12:55am
Kevin Stephen
yeah the kids are too -- really open
Aug 25, 2016 12:55am

Jul 30, 2016 11:06pm
Sophia Chirayil

Kevin Stephen

Jul 30, 2016 10:59pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 30, 2016 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
And LOL who do you think
Jul 30, 2016 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
A mouth that evangelizes must not curse
Jul 30, 2016 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
You are the retreat leader
Jul 30, 2016 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Ah but you should be much better than me
Jul 30, 2016 10:58pm
Sophia Chirayil
who was the partner haha
Jul 30, 2016 10:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
true much better than me
Jul 30, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Especially since I no longer have a partner 2 do this with me
Jul 30, 2016 10:56pm
Kevin Stephen
But! I'm doing pretty well
Jul 30, 2016 10:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahahaha I did
Jul 30, 2016 10:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
you slipped :)
Jul 30, 2016 10:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
lol i'll keep that in mind
Jul 30, 2016 10:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
but i think the long term damage is only caused by excessive use but obv im not sure plus i dont think anyone is sure lol
Jul 30, 2016 10:53pm
Kevin Stephen
But yes agreed
Jul 30, 2016 10:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Also vice is full of shit
Jul 30, 2016 10:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah so is the marginal benefits of increased intellectual stimulation worth the cost of long term health and brain damage
Jul 30, 2016 10:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
but yea it'd be cool to do research on it someday :)
Jul 30, 2016 10:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
many users move on to cocaine, heroin, and all the hard stuff
Jul 30, 2016 10:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
yea that it's a gateway drug is very true
Jul 30, 2016 10:45pm
Kevin Stephen
But you know more about this than I do having researched similar ideas haha
Jul 30, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Additionally its role as a gateway drug cannot be understated
Jul 30, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes I saw a Harvard med study a while ago that showed long term brain damage
Jul 30, 2016 10:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
i think more research needs to be done
Jul 30, 2016 10:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
but perhaps short infrequent uses can stimulate creativity and cause less harm
Jul 30, 2016 10:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
ive read a few scientific studies that show that excessive use of marijuana causes 
long term damage to the brain especially in judgement localized areas
Jul 30, 2016 10:08pm
Sophia Chirayil
oh i see what you're saying
Jul 30, 2016 10:05pm
Kevin Stephen
And right when marijuana cultivated a reputation as the counterculture's substance of choice, the government stepped in to impose what Allen St. Pierre refers to as "the idea that marijuana use creates a lack of productivity, a slobbishness, a lack of attention."
Jul 30, 2016 9:51pm
Kevin Stephen
You could cherry pick this data and go either way with this all day
Jul 30, 2016 9:50pm
Kevin Stephen
But once you read it twice and see how biased the writing is
Jul 30, 2016 9:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Intriguing yes
Jul 30, 2016 9:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
ok then
Jul 30, 2016 9:40pm
Kevin Stephen
That's like reading an article about Hillary Clinton on Breitbart
Jul 30, 2016 9:36pm
Kevin Stephen
That's when you know you're in too deep
Jul 30, 2016 9:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Lol when your source for marijuana info is Vice.com
Jul 30, 2016 9:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
putting the Church's viewpoints and health hazards aside, doesn't this intrigue you?
Jul 30, 2016 9:33pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2016 11:41pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2016 11:21pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm glad you told me about all this though
Jul 11, 2016 11:20pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah Soph i know

Sophia Chirayil

Kevin Stephen
you have no idea
Jul 11, 2016 11:18pm
Kevin Stephen
couldn't do this anymore man
Jul 11, 2016 11:18pm
Kevin Stephen
same reason i chose harvard
Jul 11, 2016 11:17pm
Sophia Chirayil
rutgers, northeastern, boston college, BU were all cheaper or the same financially
Jul 11, 2016 11:16pm
Sophia Chirayil
to get away
Jul 11, 2016 11:15pm
Sophia Chirayil
it was why i chose vandy
Jul 11, 2016 11:15pm
Sophia Chirayil
tbh
Jul 11, 2016 11:15pm
Sophia Chirayil

malayalee community
Jul 11, 2016 11:14pm
Kevin Stephen
surprise
Jul 11, 2016 11:14pm
Kevin Stephen
that it's gossip-prone?
Jul 11, 2016 11:14pm
Sophia Chirayil
what actually disturbs me is our church
Jul 11, 2016 11:14pm
Sophia Chirayil
true
Jul 11, 2016 11:13pm
Kevin Stephen
well, you win some and you lose some
Jul 11, 2016 11:13pm
Kevin Stephen
she always gave me the faithful girlfriend vibe
Jul 11, 2016 11:12pm
Sophia Chirayil
i guess i was blinded too
Jul 11, 2016 11:12pm
Sophia Chirayil
she always gave me a spiritual girl vibe in ccd class
Jul 11, 2016 11:12pm
Kevin Stephen
woke me up
Jul 11, 2016 11:11pm
Kevin Stephen
bam
Jul 11, 2016 11:11pm
Kevin Stephen
that was one of the things that
Jul 11, 2016 11:11pm
Kevin Stephen
i mean i was as well but that's because i was blinded
Jul 11, 2016 11:11pm
Sophia Chirayil
i guess you never know people
Jul 11, 2016 11:10pm
Sophia Chirayil
i really didn't expect that from her
Jul 11, 2016 11:10pm
Sophia Chirayil
very much so
Jul 11, 2016 11:10pm
Sophia Chirayil
yes i was
Jul 11, 2016 11:10pm
Kevin Stephen
yes
Jul 11, 2016 11:10pm
Sophia Chirayil
about britt?
Jul 11, 2016 11:10pm
Kevin Stephen
but were you really surprised?
Jul 11, 2016 11:10pm
Kevin Stephen
not to be malicious here
Jul 11, 2016 11:10pm
Kevin Stephen
Why?
Jul 11, 2016 11:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
all of this disturbs me
Jul 11, 2016 11:09pm
Kevin Stephen
unfortunately britt's reputation isn't looking too good in the near future
Jul 11, 2016 11:08pm
Kevin Stephen
it will go away in its own time
Jul 11, 2016 11:08pm
Kevin Stephen
so we don't have to worry too much about htat
Jul 11, 2016 11:08pm
Kevin Stephen
as for jovlyn, it is altogether possible that keith told her -- or that someone overheard when he mentioned it
Jul 11, 2016 11:08pm
Kevin Stephen
i wish that was all i needed
Jul 11, 2016 11:07pm
Kevin Stephen
hahaha i wish
Jul 11, 2016 11:07pm
Sophia Chirayil
that's all you need
Jul 11, 2016 11:06pm
Sophia Chirayil
you know your own worth
Jul 11, 2016 11:06pm
Sophia Chirayil
you do you
Jul 11, 2016 11:06pm
Sophia Chirayil
no that makes sense
Jul 11, 2016 11:06pm
Kevin Stephen
if that makes any sense
Jul 11, 2016 11:05pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm trying to stop trying to please people
Jul 11, 2016 11:05pm
Kevin Stephen
i know
Jul 11, 2016 11:05pm
Sophia Chirayil
ppl will find something bad to say some way or another
Jul 11, 2016 11:02pm
Sophia Chirayil
honestly kevin i don't think we can ever please everyone
Jul 11, 2016 11:02pm
Sophia Chirayil
whatev it's just joshua
Jul 11, 2016 11:01pm
Kevin Stephen
because they were the same instruments playing during the entire mass
Jul 11, 2016 11:00pm
Kevin Stephen
that makes sense
Jul 11, 2016 11:00pm
Kevin Stephen
or wait
Jul 11, 2016 11:00pm
Kevin Stephen
i wonder why he didn't also get annoyed that we somehow added a lead electric guitar and a bass guitar as well?
Jul 11, 2016 11:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
lol
Jul 11, 2016 10:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah i wasn't planning on carrying the keyboard into the fellowship hall and up the stairs for a 10 minute practice
Jul 11, 2016 10:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
in my head i was thinking what frickin difference does it make
Jul 11, 2016 10:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
he said during the practice you only sang and didn't play so he was annoyed that you played during the actual thing w/o telling him
Jul 11, 2016 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
what'd he say
Jul 11, 2016 10:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
i told him to "let it go"
Jul 11, 2016 10:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
how surprising
Jul 11, 2016 10:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
he told me too
Jul 11, 2016 10:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
hahaha
Jul 11, 2016 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
i was like "that's great" and my parents started laughing
Jul 11, 2016 10:56pm
Kevin Stephen
ryan said this
Jul 11, 2016 10:56pm
Kevin Stephen
because joshua disapproved of my playing piano for the ending song
Jul 11, 2016 10:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
well you are a visionary
Jul 11, 2016 10:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
how did joshua come up during dinner
Jul 11, 2016 10:55pm
Kevin Stephen
i didnt know it'd be so prophetic
Jul 11, 2016 10:54pm
Kevin Stephen
oh yeah i said that last night at dinner
Jul 11, 2016 10:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
joshua doesn't know how keep his mouth shut either
Jul 11, 2016 10:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
me
Jul 11, 2016 10:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
before
Jul 11, 2016 10:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
she even told joshua
Jul 11, 2016 10:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
she has no concerns for other's privacy
Jul 11, 2016 10:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
ik that doesn't make it more forgivable
Jul 11, 2016 10:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
it's jovlyn's basic nature
Jul 11, 2016 10:52pm
Kevin Stephen
what i won't stand for is people spreading rumors about britt
Jul 11, 2016 10:51pm
Kevin Stephen
no
Jul 11, 2016 10:51pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2016 10:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
i thought it was bc of ur parents
Jul 11, 2016 10:50pm
Kevin Stephen

Jul 11, 2016 10:50pm
Kevin Stephen

Jul 11, 2016 10:50pm
Kevin Stephen
sigh
Jul 11, 2016 10:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
i mean what she said is more insulting to britt
Jul 11, 2016 10:50pm
Kevin Stephen
jovlyn, i mean
Jul 11, 2016 10:49pm
Kevin Stephen
and proceeds to stab me in the back

Kevin Stephen

Jul 11, 2016 10:49pm
Kevin Stephen
she smiles at me like she's my fried
Jul 11, 2016 10:49pm
Kevin Stephen

Jul 11, 2016 10:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
but isn't it better knowing
Jul 11, 2016 10:49pm
Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2016 10:47pm
Kevin Stephen

Jul 11, 2016 10:46pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2016 10:43pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2016 10:43pm
Kevin Stephen

Jul 11, 2016 10:42pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2016 10:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
and she also kept saying "you can believe what you want, but you dont know brittany like i do"
Jul 11, 2016 10:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
and she said "a source i can't identify for their privacy"
Jul 11, 2016 10:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
bc personally i don't think brittany would do that
Jul 11, 2016 10:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
bc i asked who told her about brittany
Jul 11, 2016 10:37pm
Sophia Chirayil
she is the one starting the gossip
Jul 11, 2016 10:37pm
Sophia Chirayil
wait what im still confused
Jul 11, 2016 10:37pm
Kevin Stephen
and i hope she does not
Jul 11, 2016 10:36pm
Kevin Stephen
i don't think she does
Jul 11, 2016 10:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
what makes you think she has the password?
Jul 11, 2016 10:36pm
Kevin Stephen
because you know i wouldnt tell her
Jul 11, 2016 10:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
wdym
Jul 11, 2016 10:36pm
Kevin Stephen
or someone is spreading gossip
Jul 11, 2016 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
either jovlyn has the password to all my internet accounts
Jul 11, 2016 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah so
Jul 11, 2016 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
that's what i forgot
Jul 11, 2016 10:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
that this is happening
Jul 11, 2016 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen

Jul 11, 2016 10:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
i just wanted you to know
Jul 11, 2016 10:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
no whether that's true or not is not my business
Jul 11, 2016 10:35pm
Kevin Stephen
are you concerned with what she's saying is true
Jul 11, 2016 10:34pm
Sophia Chirayil
if she had only told me, then fine
Jul 11, 2016 10:34pm
Sophia Chirayil
anyway i am just mad bc she is so annoying and pounces on any opportunity to spoil ppl's reputations in church
Jul 11, 2016 10:34pm
Kevin Stephen
i hate gossip
Jul 11, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen
i can't do this anymore
Jul 11, 2016 10:33pm
Kevin Stephen
sigh
Jul 11, 2016 10:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
bc jovlyn is just spreading shit around
Jul 11, 2016 10:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
and now im actually like WTF IS GOING ON
Jul 11, 2016 10:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
he says "does it have anything to do with brittany sending keith nudes?"
Jul 11, 2016 10:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
and then the scariest part of all
Jul 11, 2016 10:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
and im like "i dont want to say it bc i doubt it's even true"
Jul 11, 2016 10:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
so then he's like "why what did she say?"
Jul 11, 2016 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
and then waht
Jul 11, 2016 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
oh gosh
Jul 11, 2016 10:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
and im like "actually i got super weirded out by her so i got away from her"
Jul 11, 2016 10:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
so he is like "where'd you lose jovlyn?"
Jul 11, 2016 10:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
and joshua is there and he saw me talking to jovlyn

Kevin Stephen
sophia whatever goes on in this conversation after this point remains confidential
Jul 11, 2016 10:28pm
Sophia Chirayil
so im like "i gotta go get mango lassi" to escape from her bc i am disturbed rn
Jul 11, 2016 10:28pm
Kevin Stephen
what
Jul 11, 2016 10:27pm
Sophia Chirayil
at this point i am actually like WTF
Jul 11, 2016 10:27pm
Kevin Stephen
oh no
Jul 11, 2016 10:27pm
Sophia Chirayil
"and bc she sent nudes to keith"
Jul 11, 2016 10:27pm
Kevin Stephen
lol
Jul 11, 2016 10:27pm
Sophia Chirayil
and she says "he broke up w her bc she was too clingy"
Jul 11, 2016 10:27pm
Kevin Stephen
lol
Jul 11, 2016 10:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
and im like ok
Jul 11, 2016 10:26pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2016 10:26pm
Sophia Chirayil

Jul 11, 2016 10:26pm
Kevin Stephen

Jul 11, 2016 10:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
i was debating whether or not to tell you this the whole day
Jul 11, 2016 10:25pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm listening
Jul 11, 2016 10:24pm
Sophia Chirayil
now is where you actually have to pay attention bc it actually concerns u
Jul 11, 2016 10:24pm
Sophia Chirayil
at perunal
Jul 11, 2016 10:24pm
Sophia Chirayil
until yesterday
Jul 11, 2016 10:23pm
Sophia Chirayil
and it's not like any of this affects me or anyone else right
Jul 11, 2016 10:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Oh wow
Jul 11, 2016 10:23pm
Sophia Chirayil
but ok whatev maybe she is lonely and just needs someone to tell all these made up stories to
Jul 11, 2016 10:23pm
Sophia Chirayil
none of which i believe is true
Jul 11, 2016 10:22pm
Sophia Chirayil
and is currently dating someone she met on tinder named romario
Jul 11, 2016 10:22pm
Sophia Chirayil
had sex w 4 of them
Jul 11, 2016 10:21pm
Sophia Chirayil
for example she has told me she has had 22 boyfriends
Jul 11, 2016 10:21pm
Sophia Chirayil
and she always lies about the strangest crap as if she is proud of it or something
Jul 11, 2016 10:21pm
Sophia Chirayil
like i don't actually enjoy talking to her bc she is always saying weird things but for some reason i feel obliged to be nice to her and talk to her anyway
Jul 11, 2016 10:20pm
Sophia Chirayil
so to start off my friendship w jovlyn is kinda weird
Jul 11, 2016 10:19pm
Sophia Chirayil
that's fine

Kevin Stephen

You just need chords or full sheet notation? Chords will only take a few minutes, the latter will take much longer
Jun 27, 2016 1:02am
Kevin Stephen
Lmao payment no

Kevin Stephen
Sure thing I'll send the chords over Tuesday night after VBS

May 20, 2016 4:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
I even ate extra food today for fuel
May 20, 2016 4:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
No physical running
May 20, 2016 4:25pm
Sophia Chirayil
Wow I completely misunderstood this
May 20, 2016 4:25pm
Sophia Chirayil
It's a like a "car run"
May 20, 2016 4:25pm
Sophia Chirayil
The midnight run is not an actual run
May 20, 2016 4:25pm
Sophia Chirayil

Kevin Stephen

May 20, 2016 9:59am
Sophia Chirayil

May 20, 2016 9:59am
Sophia Chirayil

May 20, 2016 9:59am
Sophia Chirayil
Beautiful wow
May 20, 2016 9:59am
Kevin Stephen
Yup texted Mariya
May 20, 2016 9:59am
Sophia Chirayil
Ok I forwarded it to you, you should ask Mariya though so she can make arrangements
May 20, 2016 9:59am
Kevin Stephen
You sent a photo.

May 20, 2016 9:59am
Kevin Stephen
Interrupting this conversation to send you this pic
May 20, 2016 9:58am
Kevin Stephen
Also
May 20, 2016 9:58am
Kevin Stephen
Did we send an email about that to the youth? Idts
May 20, 2016 9:58am
Kevin Stephen
I didn't get any info about a signup
May 20, 2016 9:57am
Sophia Chirayil
Since she's coordinating it
May 20, 2016 9:57am
Sophia Chirayil
You should probably ask her
May 20, 2016 9:57am
Kevin Stephen
Oh yikes
May 20, 2016 9:57am
Sophia Chirayil
I can forward it to you
May 20, 2016 9:57am
Sophia Chirayil
I don't know if you had to sign up earlier because Mariya sent out an email earlier which had a list of the people for each car
May 20, 2016 9:57am
Sophia Chirayil
Yea I think so
May 20, 2016 9:57am
Kevin Stephen
After Mass?
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Sophia Chirayil
Idk the distance but probs something like a 5K
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Kevin Stephen
Sure I'm not doing anything tn
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Kevin Stephen
Ohh interesting
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Sophia Chirayil
Through the streets I think
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Kevin Stephen
Run like 5K?
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Sophia Chirayil
And there is a run as well
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Kevin Stephen
Ohh ok
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Sophia Chirayil
In NYC
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Sophia Chirayil
Yea we drop the items off tonight
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Kevin Stephen
Like what is the run itself
May 20, 2016 9:56am
Kevin Stephen
But what is actually happening tonight
May 20, 2016 9:55am
Kevin Stephen
I sent an email about it last week
May 20, 2016 9:55am
Kevin Stephen
N I know that
May 20, 2016 9:55am
Sophia Chirayil
The box in the lobby
May 20, 2016 9:55am
Sophia Chirayil
You know the food/clothing/supply drive
May 20, 2016 9:55am
Sophia Chirayil
Someone really pays attention in church
May 20, 2016 9:55am
Kevin Stephen
What is it üòÇ
May 20, 2016 9:53am
Kevin Stephen
Soph pls
May 20, 2016 9:53am
Sophia Chirayil
tonight
May 20, 2016 9:53am
Sophia Chirayil
lol
May 20, 2016 9:53am
Kevin Stephen
When is it?
May 20, 2016 9:06am
Sophia Chirayil
are you going to the midnight run?
May 19, 2016 5:53pm
Kevin Stephen
will talk later
May 18, 2016 9:44pm
Kevin Stephen
yes yes
May 18, 2016 9:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
Focus on your exam :)
May 18, 2016 9:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
Anyway we should debate the morality of Beyonce's motives another time
May 18, 2016 9:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
Music is much stronger than words
May 18, 2016 9:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
And bring these issues to light
May 18, 2016 9:34pm
Sophia Chirayil
And because she is Beyonce, she will receive a lot of viewers
May 18, 2016 9:34pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yea but she's using that to highlight corruption in the nation
May 18, 2016 9:34pm
Kevin Stephen
But I am nonetheless disillusioned by her
May 18, 2016 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
I suppose a Beyonc√© fan would disagree entirely
May 18, 2016 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Anyways this is all just one way to look at it
May 18, 2016 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
Like one of her videos literally had Trayvon Martin's mother holding a picture of her son
May 18, 2016 9:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
She's not using people's suffering
May 18, 2016 9:33pm
Kevin Stephen
I think there is something fundamentally wrong about using people's suffering to make money
May 18, 2016 9:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
But in this day and age that's right
May 18, 2016 9:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
You said if someone did the conservative equivalent they would get a lot of backlash
May 18, 2016 9:31pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm
May 18, 2016 9:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
There is nothing I think wrong in it
May 18, 2016 9:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
Her work is nonetheless empowering
May 18, 2016 9:31pm
Kevin Stephen
We in the media just have something of a convenient double standard for it
May 18, 2016 9:30pm
Kevin Stephen
Both her and Clinton use the anger of black people to get votes/support just as trump uses white anger to get ahead in polls
May 18, 2016 9:29pm
Kevin Stephen
My point stands haha
May 18, 2016 9:29pm
Kevin Stephen
True
May 18, 2016 9:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
She still got a lot of criticism for it
May 18, 2016 9:28pm
Kevin Stephen
But nobody touches BLM because it's politically taboo to criticize them
May 18, 2016 9:28pm
Kevin Stephen
If she were to do something of that magnitude on the conservative scale she'd be eaten alive by the press
May 18, 2016 9:28pm
Kevin Stephen
To condone that as an entertainer like
May 18, 2016 9:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Anti-police violence back in the 70s
May 18, 2016 9:27pm
Sophia Chirayil
I know they were dressed as the black panthers
May 18, 2016 9:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Clear as day reference to Malcolm X, Black Panthers
May 18, 2016 9:27pm
Sophia Chirayil
How is it offensive
May 18, 2016 9:26pm
Kevin Stephen
Like that costume and "formation" was so overtly offensive
May 18, 2016 9:26pm
Kevin Stephen
You sent a photo.

May 18, 2016 9:25pm
Kevin Stephen
Soph
May 18, 2016 9:25pm
Sophia Chirayil
Idk if you can say she's pandering to it
May 18, 2016 9:25pm
Kevin Stephen
It's so obvious that it's distasteful
May 18, 2016 9:24pm
Kevin Stephen
Pandering to trending anti-white sentiment among African Americans and millennial a
May 18, 2016 9:24pm
Kevin Stephen
She's doing the same thing Hillary Clinton is doing
May 18, 2016 9:24pm
Sophia Chirayil
She should use the power she has
May 18, 2016 9:23pm
Sophia Chirayil
She has such an influence on this nation
May 18, 2016 9:23pm
Sophia Chirayil
But that's good
May 18, 2016 9:23pm
Kevin Stephen
Beyonc√© has to turn every song into a political reference now to stay relevant
May 18, 2016 9:22pm
Kevin Stephen
Pls
May 18, 2016 9:22pm
Sophia Chirayil
Beyonce style
May 18, 2016 9:22pm
Sophia Chirayil

May 18, 2016 9:18pm
Kevin Stephen

Also random q: how often do you drink green tea
May 16, 2016 10:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok cool
May 16, 2016 10:32pm
Kevin Stephen
A book i would say "with"
May 16, 2016 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
if it's a physical sound i would go with "within"
May 16, 2016 10:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
A book
May 16, 2016 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
like what resounded with you?
May 16, 2016 10:31pm
Kevin Stephen
What's the context
May 16, 2016 10:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
Resounded in me?
May 16, 2016 10:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
Resounded with me?
May 16, 2016 10:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
Resounded within me?
May 16, 2016 10:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
I've read a bunch of stuff online but can't find anything that explains how to use it in reference to "me"
May 16, 2016 10:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
How do you use the word "resound"
May 16, 2016 10:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
Haha
May 16, 2016 10:29pm
Kevin Stephen
I may have a grammatical answer
May 16, 2016 9:28pm
Sophia Chirayil
I have a grammatical question
May 16, 2016 8:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
ah ok
May 15, 2016 8:36pm
Kevin Stephen
Yup I asked her about it and she said the same
May 15, 2016 8:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
and she said she had disabled fb during APs so that's probably why you couldnt respond
May 15, 2016 8:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
oh and speaking of leona; i casually asked her if she blocked you (dw i didnt mention what you said nor did she ask)
May 15, 2016 8:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
i can see if i can get a ride from leona
May 15, 2016 8:34pm
Kevin Stephen
no worries
May 15, 2016 8:33pm
Kevin Stephen
aha it's okay soph!
May 15, 2016 8:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
but i will try my best to convince her
May 15, 2016 8:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
also i am going to my friend's bday in the evening and my mom may say that it is "already enough fun for one day"
May 15, 2016 8:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
also they will probably want me to help them clean the house
May 15, 2016 8:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
hey my mom just told me we're hosting ward 6 rosary on saturday in the afternoon so i'm not entirely sure if i'll be able to make it for CE day unless i can get a ride from someone in the morning bc they will not want to drive me since they will be frantically cleaning the house
May 15, 2016 8:31pm
Kevin Stephen
Maybe not for a thrower? But for a reg guy or girl it's a lot
May 15, 2016 12:31am
Kevin Stephen
Dude that's a LOT
May 15, 2016 12:31am
Kevin Stephen
WOW
May 15, 2016 12:30am
Sophia Chirayil
Idk if that's a big deal but it's sounds like a big deal
May 14, 2016 11:27pm
Sophia Chirayil
She told me she can deadlift 210
May 14, 2016 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen

May 14, 2016 10:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
So why did shagun pick Duke
May 14, 2016 10:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
He has made some kind of orthopedic invention thing I don't even understand what it is and he was at Intel isef this weekend and got 2nd in the health science category
May 14, 2016 10:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
He is actually a freaking genius
May 14, 2016 10:29pm
Kevin Stephen
Ohh yeah makes sense
May 14, 2016 10:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
Bc Ralph also got into Princeton EA but he chose Duke instead bc he's a Robertson scholar
May 14, 2016 10:29pm
Kevin Stephen
no haha she applied EA to princeton
May 14, 2016 10:28pm
Sophia Chirayil

May 14, 2016 10:22pm
Kevin Stephen

May 14, 2016 10:22pm
Kevin Stephen

May 14, 2016 10:21pm
Sophia Chirayil
You'd say something like "wow she is majestic"
May 14, 2016 10:21pm
Sophia Chirayil
You are too refined for that
May 14, 2016 10:21pm
Sophia Chirayil
Also I haven't heard you call anyone a hot girl
May 14, 2016 10:21pm
Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil

Kevin Stephen

May 14, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
and they pick two scholars from each state
May 14, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
presidential scholars so everyone who gets a 2400 is nominated as a semifinalist in each state
May 14, 2016 10:19pm
Kevin Stephen
that's insane ^
May 14, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
i wouldn't call her a "hot girl" hahaha but ok
May 14, 2016 10:18pm
Kevin Stephen
keerthana!
May 14, 2016 10:18pm
Sophia Chirayil

May 14, 2016 10:17pm
Sophia Chirayil
I think I deleted the pic of the other hot girl

Kevin Stephen
Shagun is NJ's presidential scholar haha

Kevin Stephen
LOL sophia
May 14, 2016 10:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm maybe maybe
May 08, 2016 3:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
No dw it wasn't offensive
May 08, 2016 3:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
I think what she meant by "smart people and drugs" is that there are a lot of ppl at Monty who are legit always on weed and still get amazing grades so she was probably like being sardonic about it
May 08, 2016 3:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Natural maturation process involves these things haha
May 08, 2016 3:41pm
Kevin Stephen
That wasn't meant to be offensive
May 08, 2016 3:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok
May 08, 2016 3:40pm
Kevin Stephen
It's v possible that she just has some ordinary maturing to do hahaha
May 08, 2016 3:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Nah it's prob not a significant issue
May 08, 2016 3:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
Do you think I should talk to her
May 08, 2016 3:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
Hmm
May 08, 2016 3:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Idk I just thought it was a strange pattern
May 08, 2016 3:38pm
Kevin Stephen
Ok Leona lol
May 08, 2016 3:38pm
Kevin Stephen
"Smart people and drugs"
May 08, 2016 3:38pm
Kevin Stephen
I was like what amuses you
May 08, 2016 3:38pm
Kevin Stephen
"It amuses me"
May 08, 2016 3:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
She is the last person to be fascinated by drugs/alcohol
May 08, 2016 3:38pm
Kevin Stephen
She said something like
May 08, 2016 3:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
Wait what no no definitely not
May 08, 2016 3:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Perhaps she's just going through a phase of fascination w these things
May 08, 2016 3:37pm
Kevin Stephen
"I want to know about the drugs/alcohol"
May 08, 2016 3:36pm
Kevin Stephen
For coke scholars weekend
May 08, 2016 3:36pm
Kevin Stephen
She asked me similar questions while I was in Atlanta
May 08, 2016 3:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
Like you know it's a senior stereotype
May 08, 2016 3:36pm
Kevin Stephen
She does that a lot to me though
May 08, 2016 3:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
I mean she was probably joking
May 08, 2016 3:36pm
Kevin Stephen
Like this is me you're talking to Leona
May 08, 2016 3:35pm
Kevin Stephen
"Hope you're not stoned or drunk"
May 08, 2016 3:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Don't you find that weird
May 08, 2016 3:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Look at the message she sent me at YAG
May 08, 2016 3:35pm
Sophia Chirayil

May 08, 2016 3:34pm
Kevin Stephen
O ok
May 08, 2016 3:34pm
Kevin Stephen
That means I'm blocked right?
May 08, 2016 3:34pm

I added some notes and a few extra things in the doc so take a look and lmk what ya think
May 02, 2016 2:05pm
Sophia Chirayil
"Voy a hablar con mi profesora" or "Puedo hablar con mi profesora" would probably work better
May 02, 2016 1:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
When you use "Podria" you are creating a hypothetical situation, when I think what you mean to say "I will talk to my professor" or "I can talk to my professor"
http://www.spanishdict.com/conjugate/poder?utm_source=social&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=share
May 02, 2016 1:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
but I guess the latter is still ok, just a bit awkward
May 02, 2016 1:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
I belive it's better to say "Tengo mucho inter√©s" instead of "Estoy muy interesado"
May 02, 2016 1:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
so you can use the the t√∫ form throughout
May 02, 2016 1:21pm
Sophia Chirayil
ok you won't really need any of the formal greetings you listed because the interpersonal speaking part tests your ability to communicate in an informal situation

Sophia Chirayil
Do you have to take a language at Harvard?

Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil
Those are the level you'll get
Apr 29, 2016 2:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
The same ones I sent
Apr 29, 2016 2:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
I would go off the workbook ones you have
Apr 29, 2016 2:49pm
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 2:49pm
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 2:49pm
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 2:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
So I wouldn't know
Apr 29, 2016 2:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
Book
Apr 29, 2016 2:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
I don't have the Barron's test
Apr 29, 2016 2:48pm
Kevin Stephen
i get that
Apr 29, 2016 2:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
if I had no work to do I would probably barely sleep and just do fun/weird things
Apr 29, 2016 2:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
sleep is just how I avoid problems
Apr 29, 2016 2:48pm
Kevin Stephen
usually that is the case
Apr 29, 2016 2:47pm
Kevin Stephen
is the barron's harder than the actual test?
Apr 29, 2016 2:47pm
Kevin Stephen
hard
Apr 29, 2016 2:46pm
Kevin Stephen
SO
Apr 29, 2016 2:46pm
Kevin Stephen
and it's
Apr 29, 2016 2:46pm
Kevin Stephen
and i took a practice exam
Apr 29, 2016 2:46pm
Kevin Stephen
i have the barron's book for spanish
Apr 29, 2016 2:46pm
Kevin Stephen
anyways
Apr 29, 2016 2:46pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm pretty sure that's a more logical explanation ?? hahaha
Apr 29, 2016 2:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
um ok
Apr 29, 2016 2:45pm
Kevin Stephen
and then i fall asleep
Apr 29, 2016 2:45pm
Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2016 2:45pm
Kevin Stephen
it's more like
Apr 29, 2016 2:45pm
Kevin Stephen
not really
Apr 29, 2016 2:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
It's probably a defense mechanism
Apr 29, 2016 2:44pm
Kevin Stephen
It's v bad
Apr 29, 2016 2:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeahh I tend to get narcoleptic around exam season
Apr 29, 2016 2:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
I can totally imagine this
Apr 29, 2016 2:43pm
Kevin Stephen
When I fell asleep on the book the highlighter just sunk into the page
Apr 29, 2016 2:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
Typical Kevin
Apr 29, 2016 2:43pm
Kevin Stephen
"Sleep marks"
Apr 29, 2016 2:43pm
Kevin Stephen
LOL

Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil
Ok thanks

Apr 27, 2016 8:12pm
Kevin Stephen

Sophia Chirayil

Apr 26, 2016 6:24pm
Kevin Stephen
Me too
Apr 26, 2016 6:24pm
Sophia Chirayil
What do I do
Apr 26, 2016 12:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
Wait won't the youth conference call conflict with practice at Anju's house
Apr 26, 2016 12:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
same same except in my case there are no tears
Apr 25, 2016 8:04pm
Kevin Stephen
So I shall talk soon
Apr 25, 2016 8:03pm
Kevin Stephen
Now sadly I must get back to crying about AP exams though
Apr 25, 2016 8:03pm
Kevin Stephen
Hey me too
Apr 25, 2016 8:03pm
Sophia Chirayil
i am very glad this conversation happened
Apr 25, 2016 8:03pm
Sophia Chirayil
i am being serious
Apr 25, 2016 8:03pm
Sophia Chirayil
this day will go down in history
Apr 25, 2016 8:03pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahahaha stop Soph
Apr 25, 2016 8:03pm
Sophia Chirayil
thank you for enlightening me
Apr 25, 2016 8:02pm
Kevin Stephen
LOL
Apr 25, 2016 8:02pm
Sophia Chirayil
i am a new person
Apr 25, 2016 8:02pm
Sophia Chirayil
this makes so many conflicting dilemmas in my mind way less complicated
Apr 25, 2016 8:02pm
Sophia Chirayil
whoaaaa
Apr 25, 2016 8:02pm
Kevin Stephen
Exactly
Apr 25, 2016 8:02pm
Kevin Stephen
But we don't allow divorce in the church
Apr 25, 2016 8:02pm
Sophia Chirayil
same thing
Apr 25, 2016 8:01pm
Kevin Stephen
No brainer right
Apr 25, 2016 8:01pm
Kevin Stephen
Should we legalize divorce?
Apr 25, 2016 8:01pm
Sophia Chirayil
that's mine as well
Apr 25, 2016 8:01pm
Kevin Stephen
It's the same as
Apr 25, 2016 8:01pm
Kevin Stephen
Different take religiously and politically
Apr 25, 2016 8:01pm
Sophia Chirayil
cool
Apr 25, 2016 8:01pm
Kevin Stephen
That's my stance anyway
Apr 25, 2016 8:01pm
Kevin Stephen
I think so
Apr 25, 2016 8:01pm
Sophia Chirayil
but not Church institutionalized gay marriage
Apr 25, 2016 8:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
so then it's possible to support gay marriage
Apr 25, 2016 8:00pm
Kevin Stephen
Just wanted to clarify my reasoning
Apr 25, 2016 7:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahahaha
Apr 25, 2016 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
thank you
Apr 25, 2016 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
i gotcha
Apr 25, 2016 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
ok
Apr 25, 2016 7:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Right
Apr 25, 2016 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
bc the church is the community of Catholic believers
Apr 25, 2016 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
the Church should never institutionalize gay marriage
Apr 25, 2016 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
actually
Apr 25, 2016 7:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
so yea it makes sense
Apr 25, 2016 7:55pm
Kevin Stephen
But that's completely different
Apr 25, 2016 7:55pm
Kevin Stephen
We should've legalized gay marriage a long time ago
Apr 25, 2016 7:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
true
Apr 25, 2016 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
If not catholic then no argument
Apr 25, 2016 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Then me being a true friend isn't about helping my friends find happiness, it's about leading them closer to God
Apr 25, 2016 7:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
but not everyone is catholic
Apr 25, 2016 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
And especially if we're talking in the catholic context
Apr 25, 2016 7:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
that's true
Apr 25, 2016 7:53pm
Kevin Stephen
It's holiness, which is quite different and means a lot more
Apr 25, 2016 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
Because happiness isn't the highest ideal of the spiritual human condition
Apr 25, 2016 7:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
but that is what you believe
Apr 25, 2016 7:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
i know you aren't directly doing anything to them
Apr 25, 2016 7:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
to believe that you can deny them of their happiness
Apr 25, 2016 7:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
what kind of friend are you
Apr 25, 2016 7:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
my point it is if those people are really your friends
Apr 25, 2016 7:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
and i wasn't trying to imply it either
Apr 25, 2016 7:49pm
Kevin Stephen
You have said that before yes
Apr 25, 2016 7:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
no
Apr 25, 2016 7:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
did i say that
Apr 25, 2016 7:49pm
Kevin Stephen
Another misconception of yours: that since I go to catholic school I'm unexposed to the LGBT community
Apr 25, 2016 7:49pm
Kevin Stephen
I too know gay people who are quite close friends of mine
Apr 25, 2016 7:49pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahahaha Sophia
Apr 25, 2016 7:48pm
Kevin Stephen
And it bothers me
Apr 25, 2016 7:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
but things become very different when there are people in your life who are lgbt, people you love and care about, people who endure shit every day
Apr 25, 2016 7:48pm
Kevin Stephen
I just feel like this is something we're debating totally wrong again and again
Apr 25, 2016 7:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
i understood what you said
Apr 25, 2016 7:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
and me
Apr 25, 2016 7:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Also you haha
Apr 25, 2016 7:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
by everyone you mean saumya, varsha, and jovlyn
Apr 25, 2016 7:46pm
Kevin Stephen
That was my point on Sunday
Apr 25, 2016 7:46pm
Kevin Stephen
But like they're totally misinterpreting the context
Apr 25, 2016 7:46pm
Kevin Stephen
Everyone like rolls their eyes at Cynthia Aunty and Molly Aunty when they say the church can't possibly recognize gay marriage
Apr 25, 2016 7:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
he's cool
Apr 25, 2016 7:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
not that the current pope isnt cool
Apr 25, 2016 7:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
and somehow a cool ass person becomes pope
Apr 25, 2016 7:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
unless it way way into the future
Apr 25, 2016 7:45pm
Kevin Stephen
Ah see this is what gets me about our class
Apr 25, 2016 7:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
i know i don't expect the church to ever institutionally recognize it
Apr 25, 2016 7:45pm
Kevin Stephen
As with all church decisions
Apr 25, 2016 7:44pm
Kevin Stephen
There has to be theological bearing
Apr 25, 2016 7:44pm
Kevin Stephen
I mean the church can't just legalize gay marriage because it's good for the children hahaha
Apr 25, 2016 7:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
*a
Apr 25, 2016 7:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
because adoption is big problem
Apr 25, 2016 7:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Not a theological/religious one
Apr 25, 2016 7:43pm
Kevin Stephen
But that's a social argument
Apr 25, 2016 7:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
that's why i think infertile people should also be able to marry
Apr 25, 2016 7:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmmm okay I see what you're saying
Apr 25, 2016 7:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
and the orphans need homes
Apr 25, 2016 7:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
also l/g couples are the most likely to adopt
Apr 25, 2016 7:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
the institution of marriage provides benefits for families
Apr 25, 2016 7:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
people have a right to happiness/love
Apr 25, 2016 7:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
same with infertile people
Apr 25, 2016 7:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
i get the whole thing about how l/g marriages can't create life and whatnot
Apr 25, 2016 7:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Why do you think so?
Apr 25, 2016 7:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
I think yea
Apr 25, 2016 7:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Should the church institutionally recognize/legalize gay marriage
Apr 25, 2016 7:36pm
Kevin Stephen
Hey Q
Apr 25, 2016 7:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
So undergrad name wouldn't matter to me as much I'd be more concerned about where I go to grad school
Apr 10, 2016 8:01pm
Sophia Chirayil
Whereas for me I know I want to go to grad school
Apr 10, 2016 8:01pm
Sophia Chirayil
So it where your undergrad degree is from actually matters
Apr 10, 2016 8:01pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yea so those with fields you usually start working right after undergrad
Apr 10, 2016 8:00pm
Kevin Stephen
Harvard starting salary tho >>>
Apr 10, 2016 8:00pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah Econ and CS
Apr 10, 2016 8:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
You wanna do compsci/business right
Apr 10, 2016 7:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
I mean but I guess it depends
Apr 10, 2016 7:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
So much $$$$
Apr 10, 2016 7:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Even over Harvard?
Apr 10, 2016 7:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'd pick UVA
Apr 10, 2016 7:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
I thought I told you this already
Apr 10, 2016 7:59pm
Kevin Stephen
What would you choose?
Apr 10, 2016 7:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Haven't decided yet
Apr 10, 2016 7:58pm
Sophia Chirayil
Have u decided yet
Apr 10, 2016 7:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Lol college decisions <<<<
Apr 10, 2016 7:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Harvard was great
Apr 10, 2016 7:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Break was great
Apr 10, 2016 7:58pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok gotcha
Apr 10, 2016 7:57pm
Kevin Stephen
No I'm just explaining why I was being "elusive" yesterday haha
Apr 10, 2016 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
How was your spring break
Apr 10, 2016 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
Sorry
Apr 10, 2016 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
Just one question led to another
Apr 10, 2016 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
It's not my business anyway
Apr 10, 2016 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok I will stop
Apr 10, 2016 7:57pm
Kevin Stephen
It's not an easy subject discussing how my parents dislike Brittany in public bc I don't want everyone to know/think that
Apr 10, 2016 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
Also I feel like we haven't actually talked in a while
Apr 10, 2016 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
I am genuinely concerned about you too
Apr 10, 2016 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
And no it is not entertainment for me
Apr 10, 2016 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
It was just because of how elusive you were yesterday
Apr 10, 2016 7:56pm
Kevin Stephen
It's like you find entertainment in things that genuinely worry/concern me
Apr 10, 2016 7:55pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm just unsure why you're so suddenly curious about my personal life
Apr 10, 2016 7:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
Also is this conversation bothering you
Apr 10, 2016 7:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes
Apr 10, 2016 7:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
Do they know you're still together
Apr 10, 2016 7:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok
Apr 10, 2016 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
They don't want me to associate with Brittany
Apr 10, 2016 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
No Sophia
Apr 10, 2016 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
There's also no reason for them to particularly like her
Apr 10, 2016 7:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
So they don't trust her
Apr 10, 2016 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
They don't like her
Apr 10, 2016 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
They trust me
Apr 10, 2016 7:53pm
Kevin Stephen
No haha
Apr 10, 2016 7:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
They don't trust you
Apr 10, 2016 7:53pm
Kevin Stephen
Actually not true
Apr 10, 2016 7:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok I get it
Apr 10, 2016 7:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm hard to weird out
Apr 10, 2016 7:53pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes I'm intentionally weirding you out hahahaha
Apr 10, 2016 7:53pm
Kevin Stephen
Mmmmmmmmm
Apr 10, 2016 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
Whatever we want
Apr 10, 2016 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
A night together
Apr 10, 2016 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
Because we can do whatever we want at prom
Apr 10, 2016 7:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
So why does whether you go together or not make difference
Apr 10, 2016 7:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
Y'all are still together and your parents know that right
Apr 10, 2016 7:51pm
Kevin Stephen
What difference between what?
Apr 10, 2016 7:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
So what difference does it make
Apr 10, 2016 7:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Uhmhm okay
Apr 10, 2016 7:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
Idk the way you said that
Apr 10, 2016 7:49pm
Kevin Stephen
Why wouldn't we be haha

Dec 12, 2015 12:42am

Dec 12, 2015 12:41am

Dec 12, 2015 12:41am
Kevin Stephen
i'll be fine
Dec 12, 2015 12:41am
Kevin Stephen
think about what will happen to brittany if i break up with her
Dec 12, 2015 12:41am
Kevin Stephen
it's not the mistake
Dec 12, 2015 12:41am
Sophia Chirayil
just bc you make 1 mistake doesn't mean you contemplate suicide
Dec 12, 2015 12:40am
Sophia Chirayil
c'mon kevin
Dec 12, 2015 12:40am
Kevin Stephen
is this before or after i jump off the bridge
Dec 12, 2015 12:40am
Kevin Stephen
jump off the bridge
Dec 12, 2015 12:40am
Sophia Chirayil
no metaphors pls
Dec 12, 2015 12:40am
Kevin Stephen
jump
Dec 12, 2015 12:40am
Kevin Stephen
'fall
Dec 12, 2015 12:39am
Sophia Chirayil
speak clearly
Dec 12, 2015 12:39am
Sophia Chirayil
in the future
Dec 12, 2015 12:39am
Sophia Chirayil
but for now that's where it belongs
Dec 12, 2015 12:39am
Kevin Stephen
yeah so is this before or after i fall off the bridge
Dec 12, 2015 12:39am
Sophia Chirayil
that there is a very possible future for the 2 of you
Dec 12, 2015 12:39am
Sophia Chirayil
reassure her that this isn't the end
Dec 12, 2015 12:38am
Sophia Chirayil
in the case that you do break up with her
Dec 12, 2015 12:38am
Sophia Chirayil
uh ok
Dec 12, 2015 12:38am
Kevin Stephen
among more serious other reasons
Dec 12, 2015 12:37am
Sophia Chirayil
she broke up with alvin for the same reason
Dec 12, 2015 12:37am
Sophia Chirayil
but she'd understand
Dec 12, 2015 12:37am
Sophia Chirayil
i know it'd be hard to break up with her
Dec 12, 2015 12:37am
Kevin Stephen
it's also like not right to just break up w her for no reason other than my fears of being in a relationship too early
Dec 12, 2015 12:36am
Kevin Stephen
i know that you're right
Dec 12, 2015 12:36am
Sophia Chirayil
but you also need to face reality
Dec 12, 2015 12:36am
Sophia Chirayil
it's good to be optimistic
Dec 12, 2015 12:35am
Sophia Chirayil
esp. with college and internships and jobs and maybe moving to other places in the world
Dec 12, 2015 12:35am
Kevin Stephen
it's not easy, but it's nevertheless possible
Dec 12, 2015 12:35am
Sophia Chirayil
that's insane
Dec 12, 2015 12:34am
Sophia Chirayil
like thats 7-9 years!
Dec 12, 2015 12:34am
Sophia Chirayil
do you think it's easy to continue a relationship from now until you're like at least 25-27,when you'll probably get married
Dec 12, 2015 12:34am
Sophia Chirayil
let's say you continued dating her
Dec 12, 2015 12:32am
Sophia Chirayil
ok but please understand WHY you shouldn't be dating Brittany
Dec 12, 2015 12:32am
Kevin Stephen
3) i should talk to you a lot more
Dec 12, 2015 12:30am
Kevin Stephen
2) shouldn't be dating brittany
Dec 12, 2015 12:30am
Kevin Stephen
1) i'm so stupid
Dec 12, 2015 12:29am
Sophia Chirayil
yea
Dec 12, 2015 12:29am
Kevin Stephen
this conversation
Dec 12, 2015 12:29am
Sophia Chirayil
so tell me what have you gotten out of this so far
Dec 12, 2015 12:29am
Kevin Stephen
my weakness is 1 pretty girl damn
Dec 12, 2015 12:28am
Sophia Chirayil
;)
Dec 12, 2015 12:27am
Sophia Chirayil
maybe we have different strengths
Dec 12, 2015 12:27am
Kevin Stephen
lol why do you make me sound so stupid
Dec 12, 2015 12:26am
Sophia Chirayil
?
Dec 12, 2015 12:26am
Sophia Chirayil
before you became romantic with her
Dec 12, 2015 12:26am
Sophia Chirayil
like you wanted to be really good friends with her
Dec 12, 2015 12:26am
Sophia Chirayil
oh i get it
Dec 12, 2015 12:26am
Sophia Chirayil
wtf
Dec 12, 2015 12:26am
Kevin Stephen
friendship
Dec 12, 2015 12:25am
Kevin Stephen
i was looking for a serious
Dec 12, 2015 12:25am
Sophia Chirayil
you never intended for it to be serious
Dec 12, 2015 12:23am
Sophia Chirayil
wdym
Dec 12, 2015 12:23am
Sophia Chirayil
ok
Dec 12, 2015 12:23am
Sophia Chirayil
you're 17 for godsakes!!
Dec 12, 2015 12:23am
Sophia Chirayil
there is no too late
Dec 12, 2015 12:23am
Kevin Stephen
a good reason to break up with her before it is too late
Dec 12, 2015 12:22am
Sophia Chirayil
what "good reason"?
Dec 12, 2015 12:22am
Kevin Stephen
i never did
Dec 12, 2015 12:22am
Kevin Stephen
i never intended this to be a serious relationship
Dec 12, 2015 12:22am
Sophia Chirayil
which is why I think it's so much better to get into a serious relationship once you have your life at least somewhat settled
Dec 12, 2015 12:22am
Kevin Stephen
sigh
Dec 12, 2015 12:22am
Sophia Chirayil
the chances of it being beneficial are slim
Dec 12, 2015 12:21am
Sophia Chirayil
so will she
Dec 12, 2015 12:21am
Sophia Chirayil
you are going to change drastically in the next 4-5 years
Dec 12, 2015 12:21am
Sophia Chirayil
and that's why relationships are complicated, because in order for them to work, the changes that each person is going through need to complement each other and harmonize for lack of a better word
Dec 12, 2015 12:20am
Kevin Stephen
maybe i'm just waiting for a good reason
Dec 12, 2015 12:19am
Sophia Chirayil
it's inevitable
Dec 12, 2015 12:19am
Sophia Chirayil
people change
Dec 12, 2015 12:19am
Sophia Chirayil
maybe even more rapid change because it's a completely new environment and you're away from your parents
Dec 12, 2015 12:17am
Sophia Chirayil
college will be the same
Dec 12, 2015 12:16am
Sophia Chirayil
i know i'm a completely different person
Dec 12, 2015 12:16am
Sophia Chirayil
do you see how drastically people can change
Dec 12, 2015 12:16am
Kevin Stephen
completely different i know
Dec 12, 2015 12:16am
Sophia Chirayil
and think of who you are as a person now
Dec 12, 2015 12:16am
Sophia Chirayil
think back to your freshman year of high school
Dec 12, 2015 12:16am
Kevin Stephen
+ praying for a call to whatever vocation i'm being called towards
Dec 12, 2015 12:15am
Kevin Stephen
and if (when?) i break up with brittany i'll be doing the same
Dec 12, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
i support you on that soph
Dec 12, 2015 12:14am
Sophia Chirayil
like he embodies every trait I want in a person and my family freaking loves him
Dec 12, 2015 12:13am
Sophia Chirayil
i mean like ZERO DOUBTS WHATSOEVER
Dec 12, 2015 12:13am
Sophia Chirayil
and when i say absolutely sure
Dec 12, 2015 12:12am
Sophia Chirayil
I made the decision that I'm not going to date in college either, unless I meet someone that I am like absolutely sure about
Dec 12, 2015 12:12am
Sophia Chirayil
and recently
Dec 12, 2015 12:11am
Sophia Chirayil
i made that decision because I know that I only want to love 1 person in my life
Dec 12, 2015 12:11am
Sophia Chirayil
but i stuck to it
Dec 12, 2015 12:11am
Sophia Chirayil
of course there were temptations, there still are temptations
Dec 12, 2015 12:10am
Sophia Chirayil
in like my sophomore i made the decision that I wouldn't date at all in high school
Dec 12, 2015 12:10am
Sophia Chirayil
Ok let me tell you something
Dec 12, 2015 12:10am
Sophia Chirayil
maybe you should've paid attention to those doubts
Dec 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
Over a year
Dec 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
About giving away my first one
Dec 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
Because I had SO MANY DOUBTS
Dec 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
I postponed the first kiss
Dec 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
Do you know how long
Dec 12, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
Sigh it's not that simple
Dec 12, 2015 12:08am
Sophia Chirayil
you should've kept it just that
Dec 12, 2015 12:08am
Kevin Stephen
Yes it was
Dec 12, 2015 12:08am
Kevin Stephen
Yes
Dec 12, 2015 12:08am
Sophia Chirayil
that it was just that
Dec 12, 2015 12:08am
Sophia Chirayil
previously i assumed when you said you and Brittany liked each other
Dec 12, 2015 12:08am
Kevin Stephen
Is making out a sin
Dec 12, 2015 12:07am
Sophia Chirayil
is it a sin
Dec 12, 2015 12:07am
Sophia Chirayil
*topic
Dec 12, 2015 12:07am
Sophia Chirayil
ok back to the topuc
Dec 12, 2015 12:07am
Sophia Chirayil
she's right
Dec 12, 2015 12:07am
Sophia Chirayil
but you're right
Dec 12, 2015 12:07am
Sophia Chirayil
yea my mom says the same thing
Dec 12, 2015 12:07am
Kevin Stephen
God didn't want you in Texas
Dec 12, 2015 12:07am
Kevin Stephen
Rice wasn't your school Soph
Dec 12, 2015 12:06am
Sophia Chirayil
it's not a good feeling
Dec 12, 2015 12:06am
Sophia Chirayil
you don't want to be rejected from your 1st choice school hon
Dec 12, 2015 12:06am
Kevin Stephen
I'd do anything rn haha
Dec 12, 2015 12:06am
Sophia Chirayil
no you don't
Dec 12, 2015 12:06am
Kevin Stephen
You
Dec 12, 2015 12:06am
Kevin Stephen
I wish I were
Dec 12, 2015 12:06am
Sophia Chirayil
i think you need to look at the context
Dec 12, 2015 12:05am
Sophia Chirayil
tbh there have been several instances in my life where I couldve easily said yes and gotten into relationships, but every time something held me back, and that's why i haven't messed up yet
Dec 12, 2015 12:05am
Kevin Stephen
I was always operating under the assumption that it's not
Dec 12, 2015 12:04am
Kevin Stephen
Is it a sin?
Dec 12, 2015 12:04am
Sophia Chirayil
i understand people fuck up and sometimes things just kinda get out of our control
Dec 12, 2015 12:02am
Sophia Chirayil
but i'm not judging you
Dec 12, 2015 12:02am
Sophia Chirayil
I'm disappointed
Dec 12, 2015 12:02am
Sophia Chirayil
I love you too
Dec 12, 2015 12:02am
Kevin Stephen
And I love you for that Soph
Dec 12, 2015 12:02am
Sophia Chirayil
I'm just trying to be honest and I'm here to help you
Dec 12, 2015 12:01am
Sophia Chirayil
you should think about these things
Dec 12, 2015 12:01am
Sophia Chirayil
yea but it should
Dec 12, 2015 12:01am
Kevin Stephen
This conversation is making me SO sad
Dec 12, 2015 12:01am
Kevin Stephen
üòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòî
Dec 12, 2015 12:00am
Sophia Chirayil
you don't know
Dec 12, 2015 12:00am
Sophia Chirayil
but she could be right too
Dec 12, 2015 12:00am
Sophia Chirayil
Obviously you can't just hold on to Britt just because of 1 kiss, she may actually be the wrong one for you
Dec 12, 2015 12:00am
Kevin Stephen
üòî
Dec 12, 2015 12:00am
Sophia Chirayil
and having to say that
Dec 11, 2015 11:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
being told that
Dec 11, 2015 11:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm afraid of both
Dec 11, 2015 11:59pm
Kevin Stephen
It literally broke my heart
Dec 11, 2015 11:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Because when Brittany told me that
Dec 11, 2015 11:58pm
Kevin Stephen
And having to tell them that they're not my first kiss
Dec 11, 2015 11:58pm
Kevin Stephen
My greatest fear is dating someone else way into the future
Dec 11, 2015 11:58pm
Sophia Chirayil
what that you won't break up with her
Dec 11, 2015 11:57pm
Kevin Stephen
With which I'm stuck because I care about her too much to break her heart
Dec 11, 2015 11:56pm
Kevin Stephen
It's a choice I made last year and which I regret
Dec 11, 2015 11:56pm
Kevin Stephen
No you're right
Dec 11, 2015 11:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
what do u fear
Dec 11, 2015 11:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm just saying that right now at this point in your life, it's probably not the wisest choice
Dec 11, 2015 11:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Do you know what I really fear
Dec 11, 2015 11:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
look I'm not trying to say Britt is not right for you
Dec 11, 2015 11:55pm
Kevin Stephen
You're right
Dec 11, 2015 11:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
would you be able to tell that to their face
Dec 11, 2015 11:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
yes but do your parents know you made out
Dec 11, 2015 11:54pm
Kevin Stephen
But yes you're right
Dec 11, 2015 11:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm my parents know though
Dec 11, 2015 11:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
imo
Dec 11, 2015 11:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
the relationship is wrong and harmful to you
Dec 11, 2015 11:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
so if the answer to that question is no
Dec 11, 2015 11:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
nothing to be ashamed about
Dec 11, 2015 11:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
it is nothing to be embarrassed about
Dec 11, 2015 11:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
if love is real,
Dec 11, 2015 11:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
"Would I be able to tell my parents about this person and how I feel about them right at this very instant?"
Dec 11, 2015 11:51pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm listening Soph
Dec 11, 2015 11:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
this is what I always ask myself
Dec 11, 2015 11:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
as for whether you should be dating her or not
Dec 11, 2015 11:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
You can figure this out
Dec 11, 2015 11:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
we see people for much greater than they really are and it fucks with our point of view
Dec 11, 2015 11:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
*distorts
Dec 11, 2015 11:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
and it distort people to such great lengths
Dec 11, 2015 11:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
we often mistake false feelings for love
Dec 11, 2015 11:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
people make mistakes
Dec 11, 2015 11:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
don't say that
Dec 11, 2015 11:46pm
Kevin Stephen
I hate myself
Dec 11, 2015 11:45pm
Kevin Stephen
But the answer is yes
Dec 11, 2015 11:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
that's for you to decide
Dec 11, 2015 11:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
I can't answer that question Kevin
Dec 11, 2015 11:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
that is kind of a big step
Dec 11, 2015 11:45pm
Kevin Stephen
That's correct, isn't it
Dec 11, 2015 11:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
but to you
Dec 11, 2015 11:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
so making out to her probably is nothing
Dec 11, 2015 11:45pm
Kevin Stephen
I shouldn't be dating her
Dec 11, 2015 11:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
yea
Dec 11, 2015 11:44pm
Kevin Stephen
Is true
Dec 11, 2015 11:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
relationships
Dec 11, 2015 11:44pm
Kevin Stephen
That
Dec 11, 2015 11:44pm
Kevin Stephen
What do you mean
Dec 11, 2015 11:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
she's been through a lot more people than you
Dec 11, 2015 11:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
You have to understand Brittany's past though
Dec 11, 2015 11:44pm
Kevin Stephen
What I've been trying to tell Brittany all week but she doesn't like see eye to eye with me
Dec 11, 2015 11:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
OK GOOD
Dec 11, 2015 11:43pm
Kevin Stephen
What's going on in my head
Dec 11, 2015 11:43pm
Kevin Stephen
You get it
Dec 11, 2015 11:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
get what
Dec 11, 2015 11:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Shit you get it don't you
Dec 11, 2015 11:42pm
Kevin Stephen
I KNOW THANK YOU
Dec 11, 2015 11:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
you literally have no clue if she's actually the right person
Dec 11, 2015 11:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
but you tbh
Dec 11, 2015 11:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm sure you have dreams for the future and everything
Dec 11, 2015 11:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
not even 18
Dec 11, 2015 11:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
personally I think what makes it wrong is that you're both still so young
Dec 11, 2015 11:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
yea I understand where you're coming from
Dec 11, 2015 11:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Is that wrong? Something I've been struggling to answer myself
Dec 11, 2015 11:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
no i understand that you just made out
Dec 11, 2015 11:40pm
Kevin Stephen
We didn't have sex omg
Dec 11, 2015 11:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
stop being silly
Dec 11, 2015 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
The act of
Dec 11, 2015 11:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
even if you didn't get one, the act itself was wrong
Dec 11, 2015 11:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
it's not about the hickey dude
Dec 11, 2015 11:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
ok I'll talk to you rn
Dec 11, 2015 11:38pm
Kevin Stephen
Sorry to Brittany? But I didn't give her one
Dec 11, 2015 11:38pm

Sophia Chirayil

Dec 11, 2015 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen

Sophia Chirayil

Dec 11, 2015 11:31pm
Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil

Oct 14, 2015 7:18pm
Kevin Stephen
where are you applying early?
Oct 14, 2015 7:18pm
Sophia Chirayil
I was considering applying there and UMich, but I think I'll save it for RD depending on what happens
Oct 14, 2015 7:17pm
Sophia Chirayil
Oh ok
Oct 14, 2015 7:17pm
Kevin Stephen
and UVA
Oct 14, 2015 7:17pm
Sophia Chirayil
So either way, besides Rutgers, you're only applying to 1 school in the early session?
Oct 14, 2015 7:16pm
Sophia Chirayil
Recruitment from Wharton will probably land you better opportunities
Oct 14, 2015 7:15pm
Sophia Chirayil
That's true
Oct 14, 2015 7:15pm
Kevin Stephen
and on-campus recruitment is a huge factor
Oct 14, 2015 7:14pm
Kevin Stephen
one of them is a liberal arts degree, one of them is applied economics
Oct 14, 2015 7:14pm
Kevin Stephen
but there's a significant difference between a princeton econ/engineering degree and the same degree from wharton
Oct 14, 2015 7:14pm
Kevin Stephen
umm yes sort of
Oct 14, 2015 7:13pm
Sophia Chirayil
Also tbh my belief is that statistics are statistics. The job you get and the salary you make will depend more on how you project yourself in the work environment
Oct 14, 2015 7:13pm
Kevin Stephen
truee but if i went there for undergrad i wouldn't need an mba
Oct 14, 2015 7:12pm
Sophia Chirayil
You could always get an MBA from Wharton later ya know
Oct 14, 2015 7:11pm
Kevin Stephen
vs princeton that's like $75k
Oct 14, 2015 7:11pm
Kevin Stephen
top ten percentile of wharton grads make $130k out of college haha
Oct 14, 2015 7:11pm
Sophia Chirayil
Is there a big diff
Oct 14, 2015 7:10pm
Kevin Stephen
except the salary differential between a typical Wharton graduate and a Princeton graduate
Oct 14, 2015 7:10pm
Kevin Stephen
hmm
Oct 14, 2015 7:10pm
Sophia Chirayil
Well considering it financially of i were you, I'd do EA Princeton first
Oct 14, 2015 7:10pm
Kevin Stephen
either ED to wharton or EA to princeton
Oct 14, 2015 7:09pm
Kevin Stephen
haha idk
Oct 14, 2015 7:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
ED?
Oct 14, 2015 7:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
That's good

Aug 11, 2015 4:16pm
Sophia Chirayil
If you take several puffs you definitely can
Aug 11, 2015 4:16pm
Kevin Stephen

Aug 11, 2015 1:12pm
Sophia Chirayil

Aug 11, 2015 1:12pm
Sophia Chirayil
(I HAD NO INTENTION OF GETTING HIGH)
Aug 11, 2015 1:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
so out of pure curiosity to see what the cheesecake vapor tasted like
Aug 11, 2015 1:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
to look at something or something like that
Aug 11, 2015 1:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
and she left the room
Aug 11, 2015 1:08pm
Sophia Chirayil
and my lab partner and I were doing trials with an e-cig with cheesecake flavored e-liquid
Aug 11, 2015 1:08pm
Sophia Chirayil

Aug 11, 2015 1:08pm

Sophia Chirayil
Don't worry about it
Jun 18, 2015 12:34am
Sophia Chirayil
It's obvious
Jun 18, 2015 12:34am
Sophia Chirayil
And how she always "fixes" your clothes
Jun 18, 2015 12:34am
Sophia Chirayil
Just by the way you look at each other
Jun 18, 2015 12:33am
Kevin Stephen
What do you mean?
Jun 18, 2015 12:33am
Sophia Chirayil
Oh absolutely
Jun 18, 2015 12:33am
Kevin Stephen
LOL do we act like that?
Jun 18, 2015 12:32am
Sophia Chirayil
Of course I won't tell
Jun 18, 2015 12:32am
Kevin Stephen
Uhhhhh
Jun 18, 2015 12:32am
Sophia Chirayil
I think "best friends" might be understatement
Jun 18, 2015 12:32am
Kevin Stephen
Please don't pull a Leona
Jun 18, 2015 12:32am
Kevin Stephen
Don't tell her I said that by the way
Jun 18, 2015 12:32am
Sophia Chirayil
Haha
Jun 18, 2015 12:32am
Kevin Stephen
I'm used to it
Jun 18, 2015 12:31am
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha oh come on I'm best friends with Brittany
Jun 18, 2015 12:31am
Sophia Chirayil

Kevin Stephen

Sophia Chirayil
Alright good night kev :)
Jun 18, 2015 12:29am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah exactly
Jun 18, 2015 12:26am
Sophia Chirayil
When things get taken out of context, everything just gets screwed up haha
Jun 18, 2015 12:20am
Sophia Chirayil
Lol sorry for overreacting
Jun 18, 2015 12:20am
Sophia Chirayil
But yeah I see
Jun 18, 2015 12:19am
Sophia Chirayil
Ok but my mom does try to do a lot for my academic achievements, it's just that I like music better haha
Jun 18, 2015 12:19am
Kevin Stephen
But like do you see how I wasn't saying it to be critical or judgmental
Jun 18, 2015 12:19am
Kevin Stephen
Like three weeks ago
Jun 18, 2015 12:18am
Kevin Stephen
This was a while back
Jun 18, 2015 12:18am
Sophia Chirayil
That was a while back tho
Jun 18, 2015 12:18am
Sophia Chirayil
Ok I do remember now her saying "im gonna ask kevin what he thinks of music therapy"
Jun 18, 2015 12:18am
Kevin Stephen
Her parents nurture that in her like Remy Aunty is really proud of her musical accomplishments and emphasize them a lot but doesn't really do the same for her academic achievements
Jun 18, 2015 12:17am
Sophia Chirayil
Oh wow
Jun 18, 2015 12:17am
Kevin Stephen
And I was like she loves music it's not her fault
Jun 18, 2015 12:16am
Kevin Stephen
So she was complaining about how you want to go into music therapy and it's a terrible job
Jun 18, 2015 12:16am
Sophia Chirayil
Hahaah
Jun 18, 2015 12:16am
Sophia Chirayil
Oh so that's what this whole thing was about
Jun 18, 2015 12:16am
Kevin Stephen
Ughhh okay Leona keeps asking me to talk to you about this whole music major thing
Jun 18, 2015 12:16am
Sophia Chirayil
No she didn't
Jun 18, 2015 12:15am
Sophia Chirayil
It hurt a lot
Jun 18, 2015 12:15am
Sophia Chirayil
Actually tbh
Jun 18, 2015 12:15am
Kevin Stephen
Did she tell you why I said it
Jun 18, 2015 12:15am
Sophia Chirayil
That you would say that
Jun 18, 2015 12:14am
Sophia Chirayil
But I just wanna say it kinda hurt when she told me that
Jun 18, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
And you know I love your mom
Jun 18, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
I'm like so nice to you
Jun 18, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
Why would you hate me
Jun 18, 2015 12:14am
Sophia Chirayil
Maybe I did take it in the wrong context and I'm sorry too
Jun 18, 2015 12:14am
Sophia Chirayil
I just don't want to hate you
Jun 18, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
Alright I'm sorry
Jun 18, 2015 12:13am
Sophia Chirayil
Don't do that
Jun 18, 2015 12:13am
Kevin Stephen
Ok bye
Jun 18, 2015 12:12am
Sophia Chirayil
Oh oops did I
Jun 18, 2015 12:12am
Kevin Stephen
Because you just called me judgmental and ignorant
Jun 18, 2015 12:12am
Kevin Stephen
But that's ok
Jun 18, 2015 12:12am
Sophia Chirayil
Why would you be?
Jun 18, 2015 12:11am
Kevin Stephen
I think you took my comments in the wrong context
Jun 18, 2015 12:11am
Kevin Stephen
I'm not mad either
Jun 18, 2015 12:11am
Sophia Chirayil
I'm not mad or anything
Jun 18, 2015 12:10am
Sophia Chirayil
Alright I didn't bring this up to fight you, I just wanted to clear things up
Jun 18, 2015 12:10am
Kevin Stephen
Ok
Jun 18, 2015 12:09am
Sophia Chirayil
And it was judgmental tbh, because you chose to say that without even understanding the whole situation
Jun 18, 2015 12:09am
Sophia Chirayil
Well you made an incorrect observation
Jun 18, 2015 12:08am
Kevin Stephen
And I don't take back what I said. Nothing I said was mean or judgmental I was just making an observation
Jun 18, 2015 12:08am
Sophia Chirayil
Ok relax I understand
Jun 18, 2015 12:07am
Kevin Stephen
Why do you take it so personally
Jun 18, 2015 12:07am
Kevin Stephen
I wasn't talking shit about you
Jun 18, 2015 12:06am
Sophia Chirayil
You're entitled to your own opinion, but I think people have a right to know when they're being talked about
Jun 18, 2015 12:06am
Sophia Chirayil
A lot has happened since the SAT, my mom wants to me to take it in October
Jun 18, 2015 12:06am
Kevin Stephen
And no if someone told you things about me personally, I wouldn't want you to tell me. Because that means you're willing to tell others' secrets
Jun 18, 2015 12:04am
Kevin Stephen
I wasn't criticizing her
Jun 18, 2015 12:03am
Kevin Stephen
Like not letting you retake the SAT for example
Jun 18, 2015 12:03am
Kevin Stephen
I just said your mom is emphasizing your musical talent and she's not being optimistic about you academically
Jun 18, 2015 12:03am
Sophia Chirayil
Ok but she's my best friend and if someone talked shit about you to me, I'd let you know too
Jun 18, 2015 12:03am
Kevin Stephen
I didn't criticize your mom
Jun 18, 2015 12:02am
Kevin Stephen
I have a right to private conversations
Jun 18, 2015 12:02am
Kevin Stephen
She did not
Jun 18, 2015 12:02am
Sophia Chirayil
Honestly she did the right thing by telling me tho
Jun 18, 2015 12:01am
Sophia Chirayil
You can't tell her
Jun 18, 2015 12:01am
Kevin Stephen
Thanks Leona
Jun 18, 2015 12:01am
Kevin Stephen
So pretty much I can't tell Leona things anymore
Jun 18, 2015 12:01am
Sophia Chirayil
Is that true
Jun 18, 2015 12:01am
Sophia Chirayil
Alright so she briefly told me that you basically criticized my mom about posting my singing award stuff saying she was bragging about it because she has lost hope in me academically...
Jun 18, 2015 12:00am
Kevin Stephen
Hm? Okay I won't
Jun 17, 2015 11:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
But you have to promise not to tell Leona or get mad at her
Jun 17, 2015 11:59pm
Kevin Stephen
ask
Jun 17, 2015 11:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok I have something to ask you about
Jun 17, 2015 11:59pm
Kevin Stephen
He's good at math haha
Jun 17, 2015 11:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
Wow nice
Jun 17, 2015 11:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Taras qualified for AIME
Jun 17, 2015 11:48pm
Kevin Stephen
Haha it's impossible
Jun 17, 2015 11:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
You shouldn't even feel bad about that
Jun 17, 2015 11:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
Amc is actually fuckin hard tho tbh
Jun 17, 2015 11:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Taras and I are taking a linear algebra class at MCC next fall because we don't have anymore formal math classes at Joe's 
And I'm just praying
Jun 17, 2015 11:46pm
Kevin Stephen
I can never do well on the AMC
Jun 17, 2015 11:45pm
Kevin Stephen
Like math league I suck
Jun 17, 2015 11:45pm
Kevin Stephen
No it's confusing to explain haha
Jun 17, 2015 11:45pm
Kevin Stephen
I hate people who cheat
Jun 17, 2015 11:45pm
Kevin Stephen
LOL I'm totally kidding
Jun 17, 2015 11:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
Lies
Jun 17, 2015 11:45pm
Kevin Stephen
I just cheat massively
Jun 17, 2015 11:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
You say you're bad at problem solving but you still get good grades??
Jun 17, 2015 11:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
That makes no sense though
Jun 17, 2015 11:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
Hahaha
Jun 17, 2015 11:44pm
Kevin Stephen
Like when you sent me that math question one day I was like please God don't make me look stupid in front of Sophia
Jun 17, 2015 11:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Like I'm okay with grades I can do well but actual problem solving I suck
Jun 17, 2015 11:42pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm like not good at math haha my own little secret
Jun 17, 2015 11:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah no some of calc is so confusing
Jun 17, 2015 11:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
Some of it makes no sense to me
Jun 17, 2015 11:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah chem is gross
Jun 17, 2015 11:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
No I mean like calc
Jun 17, 2015 11:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
*chem
Jun 17, 2015 11:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
Like Chen yuck omg
Jun 17, 2015 11:40pm
Kevin Stephen
2170 "I suck at math"
Jun 17, 2015 11:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
I hate anything pure science too
Jun 17, 2015 11:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
I hate it
Jun 17, 2015 11:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
I suck at math
Jun 17, 2015 11:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
I just can't
Jun 17, 2015 11:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
I can't do engineering
Jun 17, 2015 11:40pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm not being accusatory I just wanted to talk haha
Jun 17, 2015 11:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Right no of course
Jun 17, 2015 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
I would I guess suggest double in something more mechanical - like chem or BME or engineering or bio or something like that yk? So if your dream job doesn't work out you have a great fallback option
Jun 17, 2015 11:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm still doing a STEM internship this summer, so it's not like I have my mind completely set on music
Jun 17, 2015 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah of course! Me neither about college majors even
Jun 17, 2015 11:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm still not completely sure you know
Jun 17, 2015 11:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
Haha ok thanks for the advice
Jun 17, 2015 11:38pm
Kevin Stephen
Because you don't want to be unemployed
Jun 17, 2015 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Just like idk be careful I guess
Jun 17, 2015 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Mhmm okay I'm just wondering
Jun 17, 2015 11:37pm
Sophia Chirayil
So I would imagine there's increasing demand
Jun 17, 2015 11:37pm
Sophia Chirayil
Don't know where to find a curve, but the percentage of children in the nation with autism spectrum disorders is rapidly increasing
Jun 17, 2015 11:36pm
Kevin Stephen
Like is there a lot of demand in the industry
Jun 17, 2015 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen
What's the demand curve for a music therapist?
Jun 17, 2015 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen
That's probably true
Jun 17, 2015 11:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
Private practice makes a lot more money though
Jun 17, 2015 11:34pm
Kevin Stephen
 I could make more than this full time tutoring for Olympian if we raised prices a little bit
Jun 17, 2015 11:33pm
Kevin Stephen
You sent a photo.

Jun 17, 2015 11:32pm
Kevin Stephen
Let me research for a sec
Jun 17, 2015 11:31pm
Kevin Stephen
Music therapy hmm I've never actually looked much into it
Jun 17, 2015 11:31pm
Kevin Stephen
Like it's incredible of you to want to go into that field and if I were as talented as you then I probably would want to too
But it may not be very realistic in terms of like money haha but not everyone wants money
Jun 17, 2015 11:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
*of
Jun 17, 2015 11:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
Music therapy has a pretty good amount or potential though
Jun 17, 2015 11:31pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm not trying to discourage you! I'm just saying.
Jun 17, 2015 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
But like the music industry is such a thin pyramid
Jun 17, 2015 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
You could write, produce, direct, teach, do therapy - there's a lot of stuff
Jun 17, 2015 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
Hard to come by
Jun 17, 2015 11:29pm
Kevin Stephen
They're also few and far between
Jun 17, 2015 11:29pm
Kevin Stephen
No I know there are haha
Jun 17, 2015 11:28pm
Sophia Chirayil
You're being extremely ignorant rn
Jun 17, 2015 11:28pm
Sophia Chirayil
There are more options than just being a singer
Jun 17, 2015 11:28pm
Sophia Chirayil
Um no
Jun 17, 2015 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
You know those pay like $0.50 a year
Jun 17, 2015 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
Ohh wow
Jun 17, 2015 11:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
Maybe
Jun 17, 2015 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
So do you want to get a job in music?
Jun 17, 2015 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
Mhmm you're right
Jun 17, 2015 11:25pm
Sophia Chirayil
And plus applying as a music major will probably give me more scholarship money
Jun 17, 2015 11:15pm
Sophia Chirayil
Well I like music and there's not really anything else I'm sure of majoring in...I'll add a double major in something more "academic" later I'm thinking once I get a clearer picture of what I want to do...
Jun 17, 2015 11:15pm
Kevin Stephen
Haha so tell me about it then
Jun 17, 2015 11:14pm
Sophia Chirayil
Nothing's wrong
Jun 17, 2015 11:14pm
Kevin Stephen
Literally just wanted to know
Jun 17, 2015 11:12pm
Kevin Stephen
What's wrong?
Jun 17, 2015 11:11pm
Sophia Chirayil
Oh
Jun 17, 2015 11:11pm
Kevin Stephen
Hm? Well Leona told me that you did so I was just wondering haha
Jun 17, 2015 11:10pm
Sophia Chirayil
Why are you asking me this?
Jun 17, 2015 11:10pm
Kevin Stephen
Sophia why do you want to major in music?
Jun 17, 2015 11:08pm
Sophia Chirayil

May 05, 2015 9:51pm
Kevin Stephen
Same
May 05, 2015 9:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
I still don't know how the orbitals make all those crazy shapes
May 05, 2015 9:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yea there are still things I don't understand from Chem
May 05, 2015 9:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
Woww
May 05, 2015 9:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Like I had to explain a solid six questions to her on the practice released exam
May 05, 2015 9:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
That's what I had to do too
May 05, 2015 9:50pm
Kevin Stephen
We had to teach ourselves basically
May 05, 2015 9:49pm
Kevin Stephen
HAHA wow 
Our teacher doesn't know chem so
May 05, 2015 9:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
It's still my fault I could've gotten a better score if I'd worked harder
May 05, 2015 9:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
But I'm not blaming him
May 05, 2015 9:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
He would teach for 40 mins then be like "ok I'm out" and then watch Bollywood movies on his laptop for the remaining half of class
May 05, 2015 9:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
I had the indian guy
May 05, 2015 9:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
And it depends on which teacher you get
May 05, 2015 9:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
That's not very assuring
May 05, 2015 9:47pm
Kevin Stephen
I thought Monty had a really good chem class
May 05, 2015 9:47pm
Kevin Stephen
You still passed!

After you log into PayPal on the church account
May 05, 2015 5:08pm
Kevin Stephen
Like literally it involves you putting people's emails in and billing them for the number of tickets they've purchased
May 05, 2015 5:07pm
Kevin Stephen
No!! It's really simple
May 05, 2015 5:07pm
Sophia Chirayil
Sounds complicated
May 05, 2015 5:07pm
Kevin Stephen
An invoice is pretty much a bill but connected to PayPal with a message
May 05, 2015 5:07pm
Kevin Stephen
2) messaging those who have signed up on the Facebook link but not registered officially
May 05, 2015 5:06pm
Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil
Leona told me you stole her garlic bread and a girl watching at the same table was shipping you two and that it was super awk for her
Apr 29, 2015 8:16pm
Sophia Chirayil
Mhmm

Sophia Chirayil

Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2015 8:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Sophia missed a call from you.
Apr 29, 2015 8:13pm
Kevin Stephen
You sent a photo.

Apr 29, 2015 8:12pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm guessing this is taking you a long time because a pic you look nice in is nonexistent
Apr 29, 2015 8:09pm
Kevin Stephen
I look nice in this pic:
Apr 29, 2015 8:06pm
Sophia Chirayil
Wth
Apr 29, 2015 8:05pm
Sophia Chirayil
You don't look ugly
Apr 29, 2015 8:05pm
Sophia Chirayil
That is the scariest emoticon ever
Apr 29, 2015 8:05pm
Kevin Stephen
V ugly
Apr 29, 2015 8:05pm
Sophia Chirayil
What does  mean?
Apr 29, 2015 8:05pm
Kevin Stephen
I look  hahaha
Apr 29, 2015 8:04pm
Kevin Stephen
Leona looks good!
Apr 29, 2015 8:04pm
Sophia Chirayil
So is this one
Apr 29, 2015 8:02pm
Sophia Chirayil
Sophia sent a photo.

Apr 29, 2015 8:02pm
Sophia Chirayil
I think that's a cute pic
Apr 29, 2015 8:02pm
Kevin Stephen
Whenever I try to take a cute picture with Leona it doesn't work
Apr 29, 2015 7:59pm
Kevin Stephen
You sent a photo.

Apr 29, 2015 7:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Oh yeah that makes sense
Apr 29, 2015 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
Normally Casey is rlly nice to her so it caught her by surprise
Apr 29, 2015 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
She didn't know it was you
Apr 29, 2015 7:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
But the thing is
Apr 29, 2015 7:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Because she's usually pretty cool with me joking around with her
Apr 29, 2015 7:57pm
Kevin Stephen
If I had known that I wouldn't have said any of it
Apr 29, 2015 7:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Like if someone said that to me I'd be like "go jump off a cliff"
Apr 29, 2015 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
But yea she gets scared easily and is pretty sensitive
Apr 29, 2015 7:56pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yea ik
Apr 29, 2015 7:55pm
Kevin Stephen
I was only messing around
Apr 29, 2015 7:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
Don't worry she'll be fine soon
Apr 29, 2015 7:55pm
Kevin Stephen
So sensitive
Apr 29, 2015 7:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
I think she just needs time
Apr 29, 2015 7:55pm
Kevin Stephen
:/
Apr 29, 2015 7:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Ugh what now
Apr 29, 2015 7:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
Sophia sent a photo.

Apr 29, 2015 7:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
I think this will explain
Apr 29, 2015 7:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yeah
Apr 29, 2015 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah and she didn't reply
Apr 29, 2015 7:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
She told me you were apologizing to her
Apr 29, 2015 7:54pm
Kevin Stephen
I feel terrible about the Leona thing now
Apr 29, 2015 7:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
You're just a little ignorant
Apr 29, 2015 7:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
I know you're not
Apr 29, 2015 7:53pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm not a mean person!
Apr 29, 2015 7:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
Thx so much
Apr 29, 2015 7:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
Alright
Apr 29, 2015 7:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok
Apr 29, 2015 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
So you might want to do that also
Apr 29, 2015 7:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
Sophia: Û∞ÄÄ

Apr 29, 2015 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
And I didn't take any practice tests
Apr 29, 2015 7:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
Alrighty
Apr 29, 2015 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
So if I were you I'd focus on memorizing all of those
Apr 29, 2015 7:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok
Apr 29, 2015 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
The multiple choice I just couldn't remember a lot of the people mentioned in the book
Apr 29, 2015 7:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
Wow dude
Apr 29, 2015 7:52pm
Kevin Stephen
LOL I'm just kidding
Apr 29, 2015 7:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
Oh you told me the one you got a 4 on was stat tho
Apr 29, 2015 7:51pm
Kevin Stephen
I actually got a 4 on psych
Apr 29, 2015 7:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
You make zero sense
Apr 29, 2015 7:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Well I'm a chauvinist so I can't help you there
Apr 29, 2015 7:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
Damn it if was challenging for you, wth am I gonna do
Apr 29, 2015 7:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
How
Apr 29, 2015 7:49pm
Sophia Chirayil
But you still got a 5
Apr 29, 2015 7:49pm
Kevin Stephen
I didn't use them but I remember finding the multiple choice pretty challenging
Apr 29, 2015 7:49pm
Kevin Stephen
Probably yes
Apr 29, 2015 7:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
Do those help?
Apr 29, 2015 7:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok I have the flash cards too
Apr 29, 2015 7:48pm
Kevin Stephen
The biology stuff
Apr 29, 2015 7:48pm
Kevin Stephen
And read it as you walk in
Apr 29, 2015 7:48pm
Kevin Stephen
And then memorize it the night before the test
Apr 29, 2015 7:48pm
Kevin Stephen
That's what I did
Apr 29, 2015 7:48pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah just read the barrons book over and over
Apr 29, 2015 7:48pm
Kevin Stephen
Oh gotcha
Apr 29, 2015 7:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
No self studying
Apr 29, 2015 7:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Something like that
Apr 29, 2015 7:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
Like 80% right?
Apr 29, 2015 7:47pm
Kevin Stephen
You're in the class, right?
Apr 29, 2015 7:47pm
Kevin Stephen
But you need to know everything pretty well
Apr 29, 2015 7:47pm
Kevin Stephen
And well you don't need 100% to get a 5
Apr 29, 2015 7:47pm
Kevin Stephen
There'll be questions on the biology stuff yeah
Apr 29, 2015 7:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
Also do I need to know every single vocabulary word in the Barron's book? Because there's so damn many...
Apr 29, 2015 7:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
How well should I know how seeing/hearing works?
Apr 29, 2015 7:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
Okay okay
Apr 29, 2015 7:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Know the different schools of thought for the free response questions
Apr 29, 2015 7:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Read the barrons book, and memorize the names of all the psychologists
Apr 29, 2015 7:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
AP psych tips?
Apr 29, 2015 7:39pm
Sophia Chirayil

Apr 29, 2015 4:53pm
Kevin Stephen
You're a terrible person
Apr 29, 2015 4:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
Thank you for your time. You have somewhat redeemed yourself. 
Goodbye.
Apr 29, 2015 4:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
Anyways
Apr 29, 2015 4:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
She was too scared to
Apr 29, 2015 4:52pm
Kevin Stephen
I thought she'd figure out or Casey would tell her
Apr 29, 2015 4:52pm
Kevin Stephen
But she should've just said something and I would've replied!
Apr 29, 2015 4:52pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha Casey wasn't stoned or drunk
Apr 29, 2015 4:52pm

Apr 29, 2015 4:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Taras uses the n word very often -- I do not
Apr 29, 2015 4:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok you are forgiven
Apr 29, 2015 4:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
Wow
Apr 29, 2015 4:47pm

Kevin Stephen

Apr 29, 2015 4:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
Calling someone a f-ing ni**** is not innocuous
Apr 29, 2015 4:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
Innocuous?
Apr 29, 2015 4:42pm
Kevin Stephen
You're cruel!! I played an innocuous joke on my friend & you're lambasting my character
Apr 29, 2015 4:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
And cruel
Apr 29, 2015 4:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
You are twisted
Apr 29, 2015 4:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
Not funny
Apr 29, 2015 4:40pm
Kevin Stephen
i was waiting for her to say "what??" then i would've been like "this is kevin haha" but she just took it it was really funny
Apr 29, 2015 4:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
She got really scared
Apr 29, 2015 4:39pm
Sophia Chirayil

Apr 29, 2015 4:37pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm so nice to you
Apr 29, 2015 4:37pm
Sophia Chirayil
You're definitely not more of a feminist than me
Apr 29, 2015 4:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
Mhmm ok
Apr 29, 2015 4:35pm
Kevin Stephen
the "upper hand" thing wasn't specifically for girls -- that was for people in general
Apr 29, 2015 4:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
Sure
Apr 29, 2015 4:35pm
Kevin Stephen
i feel like i would remember if i said that haha but anyways that's one comment -- everyone says things they regret later on
Apr 29, 2015 4:34pm
Sophia Chirayil
Leona said you did
Apr 29, 2015 4:34pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm pretty sure i never said that
Apr 29, 2015 4:34pm
Sophia Chirayil
"I refuse to lose a debate to a girl"
Apr 29, 2015 4:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
Lies
Apr 29, 2015 4:33pm
Kevin Stephen
i'm probably more of a feminist than you are tbh
Apr 29, 2015 4:33pm
Sophia Chirayil
Uh yeah it is!!!

Mar 05, 2015 9:41pm
Kevin Stephen

Mar 04, 2015 10:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
Perhaps you should take an eq test to find out how oblivious you really are
Mar 04, 2015 10:39pm
Kevin Stephen
i suppose so
Mar 04, 2015 10:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
But yea it's true
Mar 04, 2015 10:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
Leona sent me an article about that
Mar 04, 2015 10:30pm
Kevin Stephen

Mar 04, 2015 10:30pm
Sophia Chirayil

Mar 02, 2015 12:45am
Sophia Chirayil

Mar 02, 2015 12:44am
Kevin Stephen
Nah you're probably just tired you'll get through it easily
Mar 02, 2015 12:43am
Kevin Stephen
Haha I like tying my essays up with India
Mar 02, 2015 12:42am
Sophia Chirayil
^that's like the only part i understood
Mar 02, 2015 12:41am
Sophia Chirayil
honestly i caq't understand a word of these essays, but i like how you tie it together at the end w/ the india experience
Mar 02, 2015 12:41am
Sophia Chirayil
yeahh
Mar 02, 2015 12:40am
Kevin Stephen
I feel like we both have v high standards lol like what you were saying in class about people's pasts like I totally related
Mar 02, 2015 12:35am
Kevin Stephen
LOLOL
Mar 02, 2015 12:32am
Sophia Chirayil
um ok and Leona just added me to some google doc to help her determine whether yours or taras's essay is better??
Mar 02, 2015 12:31am
Sophia Chirayil
yeah i wouldn't want to date a drunkard either haha. but if they drank in moderation, and say that was like the only bad thing about them, idk if i'd try to impose my beliefs on them
Mar 02, 2015 12:30am
Kevin Stephen
I'm a hopeless idealist
Mar 02, 2015 12:28am
Kevin Stephen
Like I pretty much don't care when my friends or people I know do it but for like someone to look for in a serious relationship I would never approve
Mar 02, 2015 12:27am
Kevin Stephen
I don't know
Mar 02, 2015 12:27am
Sophia Chirayil
What do u think?
Mar 02, 2015 12:21am
Kevin Stephen
Haha no honestly I just wanted your opinion like I have trouble forming a cohesive opinion on it
Mar 02, 2015 12:21am
Kevin Stephen
Interesting
Mar 02, 2015 12:15am
Sophia Chirayil
its a very complicated issue,like obviously i don't find drinking a favorable habit, but i can't judge the people who do it. its so normalized in society nowadays that people see nothing wrong with it. so when they drink, they don't think it's wrong...
Mar 02, 2015 12:15am
Kevin Stephen
I don't know Sophia what do you think about people who drink?
Mar 02, 2015 12:13am
Kevin Stephen
I suppose that's one way of going about it
Mar 02, 2015 12:12am
Sophia Chirayil
i think it's ok to be indifferent to what people think of you, but not their feelings
Mar 02, 2015 12:11am
Kevin Stephen
like i'm not indifferent to others' opinions i can't be
Mar 02, 2015 12:10am
Kevin Stephen
but like i do care what you think about me
Mar 02, 2015 12:10am
Kevin Stephen
i did
Mar 02, 2015 12:09am
Sophia Chirayil
oops you did it again
Mar 02, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
wow don't think i'm a bad person sophia haha i don't drink
Mar 02, 2015 12:09am
Sophia Chirayil
yep we grow stronger
Mar 02, 2015 12:09am
Kevin Stephen
I was in eighth grade haha i had no willpower -- today i would've told them no
Mar 02, 2015 12:07am
Sophia Chirayil
besides the wine in church, nope not a drop :)
Mar 02, 2015 12:07am
Kevin Stephen
It was like half a cup
Mar 02, 2015 12:07am
Sophia Chirayil
oh
Mar 02, 2015 12:07am
Kevin Stephen
lol cousins
Mar 02, 2015 12:06am
Sophia Chirayil
pressured by who?
Mar 02, 2015 12:06am
Kevin Stephen
Have you?
Mar 02, 2015 12:06am
Kevin Stephen
other than that no
Mar 02, 2015 12:06am
Kevin Stephen
Let's see one time I was at a family party and was pressured into drinking a glass of expensive wine
Mar 02, 2015 12:06am
Kevin Stephen
hmmm
Mar 02, 2015 12:05am
Sophia Chirayil
have you ever drank?
Mar 02, 2015 12:05am
Kevin Stephen
Also hooking up
Mar 02, 2015 12:05am
Sophia Chirayil
Drinking? Drugs?
Mar 02, 2015 12:05am
Sophia Chirayil
What do u define as badass?
Mar 02, 2015 12:05am
Kevin Stephen
I wouldn't want you to be badass like doing actual bad things
Mar 02, 2015 12:04am
Kevin Stephen
Okay true true but that's still not BA
Mar 02, 2015 12:04am
Sophia Chirayil
Alright what about getting our ccd class room moved?
Mar 02, 2015 12:03am
Kevin Stephen
hahaha
Mar 02, 2015 12:02am
Kevin Stephen
"Roy uncle i think we should be concretely moralistic in CCD class" is not standing up to authority, regardless of how much I agree with you
Mar 02, 2015 12:02am
Kevin Stephen
yeah ok
Mar 02, 2015 12:02am
Sophia Chirayil

Sophia Chirayil
Oh ok then cool
Mar 01, 2015 11:55pm
Kevin Stephen
We do that all the time haha
Mar 01, 2015 11:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes haha it's not like a big deal
Mar 01, 2015 11:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
Wait is that sarcasm

Kevin Stephen

Sophia Chirayil
But I sent a screenshot of our chat to Leona

Sophia Chirayil
Shouldn't have done this

Sophia Chirayil
I'm a terrible person
Mar 01, 2015 11:53pm
Sophia Chirayil

Kevin Stephen

Mar 01, 2015 11:37pm
Sophia Chirayil
Like if ppl think you two are dating, what's the worst that will happen? They will just keep thinking that...You know what the truth is, isn't all that matters? Only God can really judge you
Mar 01, 2015 11:36pm
Kevin Stephen
Just that's always been my mindset like my reputation is what people think about my character
Mar 01, 2015 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha no you're probably right
Mar 01, 2015 11:35pm
Sophia Chirayil

Feb 28, 2015 6:49pm
Sophia Chirayil

Kevin Stephen
She just has like no idea hahaha

Sophia Chirayil
Yea but what can ya do
She acts like she runs the whole place or something
Feb 28, 2015 6:48pm
Kevin Stephen
Jovlin shouldn't let her personal predispositions offend others
Feb 28, 2015 6:46pm
Kevin Stephen
what that's so weird
Feb 28, 2015 6:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
He told her he could play it but she was like "no I'm gonna get kevin"
And when me and Leona asked why he wasn't playing he said that jovlin was getting you and he was scared of asking her not to
Feb 28, 2015 6:41pm
Kevin Stephen
huh? why
Feb 28, 2015 6:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
He was scared of jovlin
Feb 28, 2015 6:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
No it wasn't you he was scared of
Feb 28, 2015 6:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Jovlin called me to play piano I didn't know Melvin could play for the stations! I wasn't trying to scare him away or anything
Feb 28, 2015 6:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Ah yesterday

Kevin Stephen
Opportunity of a lifetime I've heard
Feb 21, 2015 12:25am
Kevin Stephen
Like apparently they go on trips to different places
Feb 21, 2015 12:25am
Kevin Stephen
I think it's like fun stuff
Feb 21, 2015 12:25am
Sophia Chirayil
I would apply just for the heck of it but seminars are just not my thing
Feb 21, 2015 12:25am
Sophia Chirayil
That's cool
Feb 21, 2015 12:24am
Kevin Stephen
Our cross country captain this year got in
Feb 21, 2015 12:24am
Kevin Stephen
Ridiculously hard to get into haha
Feb 21, 2015 12:24am
Sophia Chirayil
Oh wow that's cool
Feb 21, 2015 12:24am
Kevin Stephen
Nope it's free
Feb 21, 2015 12:24am
Kevin Stephen
They bring in Ivy League professors and Nobel laureates to take classes
Feb 21, 2015 12:24am
Sophia Chirayil
If you get in, do you have to pay?
Feb 21, 2015 12:23am
Kevin Stephen
It's like seminars
Feb 21, 2015 12:23am
Sophia Chirayil
Is it research? Or taking courses?
Feb 21, 2015 12:23am
Sophia Chirayil
Woahh
Feb 21, 2015 12:23am
Kevin Stephen
And then from there they take 39 students
Feb 21, 2015 12:22am
Kevin Stephen
So competitive they take 40% as semi finalists to the school to do group interviews
Feb 21, 2015 12:22am
Kevin Stephen
It's a program at Lawrenceville
Feb 21, 2015 12:22am
Sophia Chirayil
What's nj scholars?
Feb 21, 2015 12:21am
Kevin Stephen
I have to get good at doing interviews
Feb 21, 2015 12:21am
Kevin Stephen
Trying to get into nj scholars
Feb 21, 2015 12:20am
Kevin Stephen
Hmm I'll look into it! I'll probably apply
Feb 21, 2015 12:20am
Sophia Chirayil
It's pretty competitive...like 180+ kids apply by they take around 30
Feb 21, 2015 12:19am
Sophia Chirayil
I think the app is due sometime in early March
Feb 21, 2015 12:17am
Sophia Chirayil
^info for the Partners in Science program
Feb 21, 2015 12:17am
Sophia Chirayil
http://lsc.org/for-educators/programs-at-the-center/partners-in-science/
Feb 21, 2015 12:17am
Sophia Chirayil
Your school should have been more informed jeez
Feb 21, 2015 12:15am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah :(
Feb 21, 2015 12:15am
Sophia Chirayil
Wow that's terrible
Feb 21, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
So sad
Feb 21, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
Well I got an email this morning, Taras still doesn't know
Feb 21, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
So they threw out the apps
Feb 21, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
Neither of us knew about it or did it
Feb 21, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
There was apparently an online part to the application that our school never told us about
Feb 21, 2015 12:14am
Kevin Stephen
Well
Feb 21, 2015 12:13am
Sophia Chirayil
Aw man
Feb 21, 2015 12:13am
Kevin Stephen
This morning
Feb 21, 2015 12:13am
Kevin Stephen
I will! Taras and I got rejected from governors school
Feb 21, 2015 12:13am
Sophia Chirayil
Which u should definitely apply to!!
Feb 21, 2015 12:13am
Sophia Chirayil
And I'm planning on applying to liberty science center the same one I did last summer
Feb 21, 2015 12:12am
Sophia Chirayil
I don't know yet...I applied to a Texas tech program, and a cancer institute in buffalo
Feb 21, 2015 12:12am
Kevin Stephen
Where are you doing research?
Feb 21, 2015 12:11am
Kevin Stephen
Yep definitely
Feb 21, 2015 12:11am
Sophia Chirayil
I'll probably be doing research all of July, so do you think Olympian throughout August and sept will be enough?
Feb 21, 2015 12:10am
Kevin Stephen
That's a good idea
Feb 21, 2015 12:10am
Sophia Chirayil
And I think should actually listen to my parents about when to take it
Feb 21, 2015 12:10am
Sophia Chirayil
I think I'm gonna go with the October plan, just bc I feel like March will be a bit of a risk
Feb 21, 2015 12:09am
Sophia Chirayil
Ok
Feb 21, 2015 12:08am
Kevin Stephen
I don't know haha think it over. But don't worry. Either way you'll get your score!
Feb 21, 2015 12:08am
Sophia Chirayil
That's true
Feb 21, 2015 12:00am
Kevin Stephen
That you might lose your test taking conditioning
Feb 21, 2015 12:00am
Kevin Stephen
But senior year you'd be so caught up in apps and all
Feb 21, 2015 12:00am
Kevin Stephen
Sure that would work
Feb 21, 2015 12:00am
Sophia Chirayil
Like join Olympian for part of the summer or something...
Feb 20, 2015 11:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
Do you think it would be better if I just focused on doing well in junior year and then studied really hard for the SAT over the summer for October?
Feb 20, 2015 11:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah ik everyone does
Feb 20, 2015 11:58pm
Sophia Chirayil
But
Feb 20, 2015 11:58pm
Sophia Chirayil
Though she hates late fees
Feb 20, 2015 11:57pm
Sophia Chirayil
That could work
Feb 20, 2015 11:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Then we'll ask her to sign you up for our program and the March sat
Feb 20, 2015 11:57pm
Kevin Stephen
Our pitch is very convincing
Feb 20, 2015 11:57pm
Kevin Stephen
I'll arrange for a consultation with both me and Taras to talk to your mom about our "advanced crash course" haha
Feb 20, 2015 11:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Ah I've got it
Feb 20, 2015 11:56pm
Kevin Stephen
Wish there were something I could do
Feb 20, 2015 11:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
Anyways there's no way I could study all of that
Feb 20, 2015 11:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yeah
Feb 20, 2015 11:55pm
Kevin Stephen
Oh :/
Feb 20, 2015 11:55pm
Kevin Stephen
take psychology, human geography, calc AB, macro micro envi sci and stats
Feb 20, 2015 11:55pm
Sophia Chirayil
She doesn't care whether I become an ap scholar or not
Feb 20, 2015 11:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
Either way that bribe won't work
Feb 20, 2015 11:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm taking psych this yr
Feb 20, 2015 11:53pm
Kevin Stephen
Chem yeah haha
Feb 20, 2015 11:53pm
Kevin Stephen
No Chen
Feb 20, 2015 11:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
No chem
Feb 20, 2015 11:53pm
Kevin Stephen
Which one did you take last year, psychology?
Feb 20, 2015 11:53pm
Sophia Chirayil
I can't study 6 exams in like 3 months
Feb 20, 2015 11:52pm
Sophia Chirayil
I only took 1 AP last year
Feb 20, 2015 11:51pm
Sophia Chirayil
Oh there's no way
Feb 20, 2015 11:51pm
Kevin Stephen
Haha tell your mom if she lets you take the SAT then you'll self study APs and become a national AP scholar this year
Feb 20, 2015 11:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Damn yeah this is a rare problem to have
Feb 20, 2015 11:49pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm I'm trying to think
Feb 20, 2015 11:48pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeahh that's the studying part haha
Feb 20, 2015 11:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
And hard work for sure
Feb 20, 2015 11:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Haha
Feb 20, 2015 11:47pm
Kevin Stephen
And prayers
Feb 20, 2015 11:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Justt luck and studying
Feb 20, 2015 11:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
But you still got a 2400 :)
Feb 20, 2015 11:47pm
Sophia Chirayil
Aw that's rough
Feb 20, 2015 11:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Every time I took it I got a headache and it would be terrible by the last section
Feb 20, 2015 11:47pm
Kevin Stephen
I always get a headache during the test
Feb 20, 2015 11:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yeah I just need to know how to handle test anxiety and pace myself
Feb 20, 2015 11:46pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah it's just like you probably got nervous
Feb 20, 2015 11:46pm
Kevin Stephen
Was just about to ask
Feb 20, 2015 11:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
I even got an 11 on the essay so that means I did a lot worse on MC so obviously something's wrong when I'm taking the actual test
Feb 20, 2015 11:45pm
Kevin Stephen
So that means you got like 2 wrong in math
Feb 20, 2015 11:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
Normally I would get 800s on writing but I got some wrong this time
Feb 20, 2015 11:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
710 CR 
740 math
720 writing
Feb 20, 2015 11:44pm
Kevin Stephen
What was your score breakdown? If you don't mind me asking
Feb 20, 2015 11:43pm
Kevin Stephen
No she's not. And you don't
Feb 20, 2015 11:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
Maybe I just have limitations when it comes to academics
Feb 20, 2015 11:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
The thing is I feel like my moms right
Feb 20, 2015 11:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
I literally begged them so much they won't budge
Feb 20, 2015 11:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Oh my goodness
Feb 20, 2015 11:42pm
Sophia Chirayil
My mom told me "you are an average person so you deserve this average score. You deserve to go to a mediocre college. You deserve to get an average job, make an average salary, and you will just live an average life."
Feb 20, 2015 11:42pm
Kevin Stephen
That's so rough Sophia you should try talking to your parents again
Feb 20, 2015 11:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Like forget about all the business stuff I'm talking as a friend
Feb 20, 2015 11:41pm
Kevin Stephen
No I seriously believe in you
Feb 20, 2015 11:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
You might be the only person that thinks so haha
Feb 20, 2015 11:40pm
Kevin Stephen
No way you're Sophia you're much smarter than that score
Feb 20, 2015 11:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm that's an interesting problem
Feb 20, 2015 11:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
My mom wants me to just apply with the score I have
Feb 20, 2015 11:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
But my parents are just not gonna let me take it now
Feb 20, 2015 11:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
Honestly I would
Feb 20, 2015 11:37pm
Sophia Chirayil
Haha
Feb 20, 2015 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
But give me and Taras three weeks we'll get you a 2300 haha
Feb 20, 2015 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
Wow I hate to sound like a corporate man here I really do
Feb 20, 2015 11:37pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yea but what is 3 weeks gonna do?
Feb 20, 2015 11:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
Bio and lit
Feb 20, 2015 11:36pm
Kevin Stephen
It's not too late to sign up for March
Feb 20, 2015 11:36pm
Kevin Stephen
What subjects are you taking?
Feb 20, 2015 11:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
And they said to focus on APs for May
Feb 20, 2015 11:36pm
Sophia Chirayil
No bc I have to subjects in June
Feb 20, 2015 11:36pm
Kevin Stephen
They're not letting you take may or June?
Feb 20, 2015 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Ahhh :(
Feb 20, 2015 11:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
I only got a 2170 on the jan test...like after all of that?! I thought I could've gotten at least a 2300. I literally have no hope of getting into any good college now...my parents are not even letting me retake. They said maybe in October if APs go well
Feb 20, 2015 11:34pm
Kevin Stephen
Because I mean you're right there!! Wow I'm so impressed
Feb 20, 2015 11:33pm
Kevin Stephen
When you practice I mean
Feb 20, 2015 11:32pm
Kevin Stephen
Or 20 or 21 same difference
Feb 20, 2015 11:32pm
Kevin Stephen
I mean if I can, I'll give you a pro tip hahaha: instead of giving yourself 25 minutes for the sections, give yourself 19 minutes to simulate some real pressure
Feb 20, 2015 11:32pm
Kevin Stephen
Woww you got 2380s and 2400s on practice tests?!?! Woww
Feb 20, 2015 11:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
I think I have test anxiety or something
Feb 20, 2015 11:31pm
Sophia Chirayil
I don't know what's wrong with me
Feb 20, 2015 11:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
I just panic and screw everything up and I can't keep up with the pace
Feb 20, 2015 11:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
I don't know what happens
Feb 20, 2015 11:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
But when I take the actual test
Feb 20, 2015 11:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
I got 2380s and 2400s taking the practice test at home bc I was relaxed
Feb 20, 2015 11:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
I literally practiced so hard
Feb 20, 2015 11:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
I memorized so much vocab.
Feb 20, 2015 11:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
I took practice test after practice test for the SAT.
Feb 20, 2015 11:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm not like you
Feb 20, 2015 11:29pm
Sophia Chirayil
You don't understand
Feb 20, 2015 11:28pm
Kevin Stephen
It's just a lot of studying that's all it is. If you put in the time, you'll do well. You 1000% have the capacity.
Feb 20, 2015 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Like im so bad at math just ask Taras he'll tell you haha
Feb 20, 2015 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen
Test taking is just about exposure
Feb 20, 2015 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
Nahh don't worry Sophia
Feb 20, 2015 11:26pm
Sophia Chirayil
In general I'm just a very bad test taker so I don't know if this will all be worth it
Feb 20, 2015 11:15pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok I'll see
Feb 20, 2015 11:15pm
Kevin Stephen
If you choose to take it (and you definitely can and get a 5!!) then I'll help you however you need :)
Feb 20, 2015 11:14pm
Kevin Stephen
I skyped with Merin and she showed me all of it in like one day so that was all good
Feb 20, 2015 11:14pm
Kevin Stephen
Then the hardest part for me was the volume by integration
Feb 20, 2015 11:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Integrations not too bad it took maybe two weeks
Feb 20, 2015 11:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Pretty much there's a tiny bit of differentiation left and then just integration
Feb 20, 2015 11:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Well I mean I was in precalc last year and I started studying in late January so by this time I had only covered up to related rates or so
Feb 20, 2015 11:12pm
Kevin Stephen
Ohh word
Feb 20, 2015 11:12pm
Sophia Chirayil
So there's no way I'll be prepared for the ap exam
Feb 20, 2015 11:11pm
Sophia Chirayil
Ok I'm in cp calc and it's the slowest most easiest thing ever...we just finished related rates and right now we're learning about extrema and using derivative tests to predict graphs and where max/min occurs
Feb 20, 2015 11:11pm
Kevin Stephen
What stuff don't you know yet for the exam? I can tell you if it's hard
Feb 20, 2015 11:09pm
Kevin Stephen
You're v smart
Feb 20, 2015 11:09pm
Kevin Stephen
No wtf
Feb 20, 2015 11:08pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'm too dumb
Feb 20, 2015 11:06pm
Kevin Stephen
For calc? Why not?
Feb 20, 2015 11:04pm
Sophia Chirayil
I don't think I'll take the exam
Feb 20, 2015 11:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
I'll give you ur calc book back this Sunday
Feb 20, 2015 11:00pm
Sophia Chirayil
Alright

Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen

Feb 20, 2015 10:59pm
Sophia Chirayil

Feb 20, 2015 10:59pm
Sophia Chirayil
Btw can u pls bring ur calc ab and human geo ap books tm to church? I'm considering taking one of them but I want to see how hard it is first...

Sophia Chirayil

Feb 07, 2015 2:47pm
Kevin Stephen
Alright what time do i have to get to sneha's by?
Feb 07, 2015 2:46pm
Kevin Stephen
It's actually a pretty nice song
Feb 07, 2015 2:46pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yeah I wish we were singing too
Feb 07, 2015 2:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
You're a great person
Feb 07, 2015 2:44pm
Sophia Chirayil
Lol I don't dislike doing stuff with you!
Feb 07, 2015 2:44pm
Kevin Stephen
I wish I were actually singing it tho
Feb 07, 2015 2:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahahaha this song is gonna be so ridiculous and fun
Feb 07, 2015 2:43pm
Kevin Stephen
As to whether you actually dislike doing stuff with me or not
Feb 07, 2015 2:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
Huh?
Feb 07, 2015 2:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Okay okay Sophia I'll just give myself the benefit of the doubt haha
Feb 07, 2015 2:41pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm she told me the same day it happened
Feb 07, 2015 2:41pm
Sophia Chirayil
Lol but that was a mother role and I'm terrible at acting
Feb 07, 2015 2:41pm
Kevin Stephen
lol alright. Because you did that last year too
Feb 07, 2015 2:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
When did Brittany tell you that?
Feb 07, 2015 2:40pm
Sophia Chirayil
Lip syncing to some lion king song just seemed embarrassing. I was trying to save myself
Feb 07, 2015 2:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
That had nothing to do with you
Feb 07, 2015 2:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
Holy shit
Feb 07, 2015 2:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yeah and then you get full scores
Feb 07, 2015 2:38pm
Kevin Stephen
Sophia do you really not like me that much that you tried to get Brittany to replace you in our ward part?
Feb 07, 2015 2:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Pretty much after i take standardized test i feel less confident about them every day
Feb 07, 2015 2:32pm
Kevin Stephen
Haha idk Soph
Feb 07, 2015 2:32pm
Sophia Chirayil
You'll get an 800
Feb 07, 2015 2:30pm
Sophia Chirayil
Btw I think I probably got a lot more wrong than 5 or 6 on math 2, so don't freak out
Feb 07, 2015 2:30pm
Kevin Stephen
it just had a lot of writing on it like it didn't have any flow
Feb 07, 2015 2:18pm
Kevin Stephen
that's not true!!!!
Feb 07, 2015 2:17pm
Kevin Stephen
What
Feb 07, 2015 2:17pm
Sophia Chirayil
Way better than when I help
Feb 07, 2015 1:55pm
Sophia Chirayil

Feb 07, 2015 1:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
Overall
Feb 07, 2015 1:54pm
Sophia Chirayil
Yeah but I'm sure it was good
Feb 07, 2015 1:54pm
Kevin Stephen
That's true Jasmine sang really well
Feb 07, 2015 1:54pm
Sophia Chirayil

Feb 07, 2015 1:54pm
Sophia Chirayil

Kevin Stephen
Oh my goodness now i'm scared for my score

The second one will be a little more updated but the changes are minute for psych. If it was economics I would say get the second because the test has changed a lot in the last few years. But that's not the case with psychology
Feb 06, 2014 5:44pm
Kevin Stephen
Either will work. If you want to save money get the first one

I mean I could've found it
Jan 18, 2014 4:50pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha ok thanks
Jan 18, 2014 4:50pm
Sophia Chirayil
1. The thumb is the closest finger to you. So start praying for those who are closest to you. They are the persons easiest to remember. To pray for our dear ones is a ‚Äúsweet obligation.‚Äù

2. The next finger is the index. Pray for those who teach you, instruct you and heal you. They need the support and wisdom to show direction to others. Always keep them in your prayers.

3. The following finger is the tallest. It reminds us of our leaders, the governors and those who have authority. They need God‚Äôs guidance.

4. The fourth finger is the ring finger. Even that it may surprise you, it is our weakest finger. It should remind us to pray for the weakest, the sick or those plagued by problems. They need your prayers.

5. And finally we have our smallest finger, the smallest of all. Your pinkie should remind you to pray for yourself. When you are done praying for the other four groups, you will be able to see your own needs but in the proper perspective, and also you will be able to pray for your own needs in a better way.
Jan 18, 2014 4:48pm
Sophia Chirayil
ever heard of google?
Jan 18, 2014 4:48pm
Kevin Stephen

Jan 17, 2014 10:19pm
Sophia Chirayil
4 Our Father and 3 Hail Marys...lol that doesn't even make sense
Jan 17, 2014 10:16pm
Kevin Stephen
Please do 4 our fathers and 3 Hail Marys and bring cookies to CCD class on Sunday
Jan 17, 2014 10:09pm
Sophia Chirayil
Thank you Fr. Kevin. What's my penance?
Jan 17, 2014 10:05pm
Kevin Stephen
I forgive you for not coming
Jan 17, 2014 9:31pm
Kevin Stephen

Jan 17, 2014 4:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Hey Soph
Jan 17, 2014 4:35pm
Kevin Stephen
Yep
Jan 01, 2014 10:35am
Kevin Stephen
We can forget about that last song
Jan 01, 2014 10:35am
Sophia Chirayil
besides whatever you do for god never goes wasted
Jan 01, 2014 10:35am
Kevin Stephen
The rest of it was good though
Jan 01, 2014 10:35am
Kevin Stephen
Hahahaha
Jan 01, 2014 10:35am
Sophia Chirayil
its over
Jan 01, 2014 10:35am
Sophia Chirayil
its ok
Jan 01, 2014 10:35am
Kevin Stephen
I was like so much work for nothing :P
Jan 01, 2014 10:35am
Kevin Stephen
Yeah I know I was pretty disappointed lol
Jan 01, 2014 10:35am
Sophia Chirayil
oh well i sang the chorus an octave lower anyway
Jan 01, 2014 10:34am
Kevin Stephen
Cuz when we did it in NY in the regular key, only Anjali could reach for the chorus
Jan 01, 2014 10:34am
Kevin Stephen
You sounded good on your verse
Jan 01, 2014 10:33am
Kevin Stephen
I made it three and a half keys lower so it would be easier for you to sing
Jan 01, 2014 10:33am
Sophia Chirayil
yeah it pretty low for me too
Jan 01, 2014 10:33am
Kevin Stephen
I said it was bad because my first verse was so low haha
Jan 01, 2014 10:33am
Kevin Stephen
Really?
Jan 01, 2014 10:32am
Sophia Chirayil
so people see things in different ways
Jan 01, 2014 10:32am
Sophia Chirayil
lol you just think everything is bad....you said yesterday "alive again" was really bad and brittany told me it was beautiful and almost made her cry
Jan 01, 2014 10:32am
Kevin Stephen
We needed to end our year on a silly note hahahaha
Jan 01, 2014 10:32am
Kevin Stephen
But I think the rest of the adoration was good, anyway
Jan 01, 2014 10:31am
Kevin Stephen
Mighty to save was alright but it didn't fit with the rest of it lol
Jan 01, 2014 10:31am
Kevin Stephen
M
Jan 01, 2014 10:31am
Sophia Chirayil
yes it was
Jan 01, 2014 10:31am
Kevin Stephen
Nope
Jan 01, 2014 10:31am
Sophia Chirayil
that was pretty good
Jan 01, 2014 10:30am
Sophia Chirayil
last time when we did "mighty to save"...
Jan 01, 2014 10:30am
Kevin Stephen
They never work! I can't name one time an ending song has been good
Jan 01, 2014 10:29am
Sophia Chirayil

Jan 01, 2014 10:27am
Kevin Stephen

Dec 31, 2013 5:45pm
Sophia Chirayil
the "'cause i want you, yes i want you" part
Dec 31, 2013 5:43pm
Sophia Chirayil
do u want to do that part then?
Dec 31, 2013 5:42pm

Kevin Stephen
LOL that part is good tho
Dec 31, 2013 5:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
also we pls exclude the "'cause i want you, yes i want you" part...
Dec 31, 2013 5:23pm
Sophia Chirayil

Dec 31, 2013 5:19pm
Sophia Chirayil
yeah, i can sing a verse
Dec 31, 2013 5:19pm
Sophia Chirayil
i didnt think of that...
Dec 31, 2013 5:18pm
Sophia Chirayil
oops im sorry
Dec 31, 2013 5:18pm
Kevin Stephen
It's a tough song on piano so ill be concentrating lol
Dec 31, 2013 5:07pm
Kevin Stephen
Can you sing a verse and I sing one?
Dec 31, 2013 5:06pm
Sophia Chirayil
ya know?
Dec 31, 2013 4:39pm
Sophia Chirayil
Since its sung solo, it kind of has a "freestyle" feel to it, so if multiple people sing, different words will be sung at different times....
Dec 31, 2013 4:38pm
Sophia Chirayil
For "Alive again" can you please sing the verses and then the rest of us will join on the chorus??
Dec 31, 2013 4:38pm
Kevin Stephen
Sophia can we do the O Hallelujah song instead of Come and Fill my Heart? I feel like the latter one will be too difficult
Dec 06, 2013 5:48pm
Kevin Stephen
okey dokey
Dec 05, 2013 8:35pm
Sophia Chirayil
yeah
Dec 05, 2013 8:35pm

Nov 01, 2013 6:13pm
Kevin Stephen
brittany just suggested jesus we enthrone you for the repetitive...
Nov 01, 2013 6:13pm
Sophia Chirayil
True. But it could just be a time for people to listen/reflect/meditate.
Do you want songs that are small repetitive phrases to sing in between each intercessory/thanksgiving or
Nov 01, 2013 6:12pm
Kevin Stephen
i would love to do that but nobody else would sing
Nov 01, 2013 6:11pm
Sophia Chirayil
