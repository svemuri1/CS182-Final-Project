Ally Toolan
I know I had to send it (lol sorry this is days late)
Jun 11, 2017 3:52pm
Kevin Stephen
This is so cute
Jun 07, 2017 9:44pm
Ally Toolan
Look at this we were such babies
Jun 07, 2017 3:48pm
Ally Toolan
Lol I just got your joke (it's been a long day)
Mar 14, 2016 4:44pm
Ally Toolan
Don't get me wrong I like him the best out of everyone I've looked and he has good ideas but he's just not realistic
Mar 14, 2016 4:44pm
Kevin Stephen
and yes his economics doesn't cash out haha quite literally
Mar 14, 2016 4:43pm
Kevin Stephen
I like Bernie! I don't agree with a lot of his policies haha he's too left for me but i still like the change that he represents -- moving away from superPACs to a more grassroots campaign
Mar 14, 2016 4:43pm
Ally Toolan
Bernie just isn't realistic
Mar 14, 2016 4:42pm
Ally Toolan
Don't even get me started with trump
Mar 14, 2016 4:42pm
Ally Toolan
Again agreed
Mar 14, 2016 4:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Ted Cruz is far too conservative and dishonest
Mar 14, 2016 4:42pm
Ally Toolan
I totally agree
Mar 14, 2016 4:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Clinton has horrible foreign policy judgment and is far too divisive of a figure
Mar 14, 2016 4:41pm
Kevin Stephen
I think what our country needs most right now is someone who can bring both sides together
Mar 14, 2016 4:39pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah no i agree
Mar 14, 2016 4:39pm
Ally Toolan
I just don't completely agree with any one persons ideas ya feel?
Mar 14, 2016 4:00pm
Ally Toolan
Either way I'm not too crazy about anyone
Mar 14, 2016 3:59pm
Ally Toolan
At this point I think it's between hillary and trump unless there's a huge upset
Mar 14, 2016 3:59pm
Ally Toolan
Exactly!! There is a right way and a wrong way to go about this and yes doing it wrong and I haven't looked at him too much but I've heard soo many people say the same thing
Mar 14, 2016 3:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Personally i think john kasich is our best bet right now haha but he prob doesn't have a chance
Mar 14, 2016 3:54pm
Kevin Stephen
Yeah right? I understand the frustration with the political system and the establishment but that frustration shouldn't turn into hatred and bigotry
Mar 14, 2016 3:54pm
Ally Toolan
Like we deserve better than that carrot
Mar 14, 2016 3:23pm
Ally Toolan
Hopefully I just can't believe he has as many supporters as he does it makes me sad that so many Americans think that he is the best choice for our country
Mar 14, 2016 3:22pm
Kevin Stephen
as is the rest of literate america
Mar 14, 2016 3:21pm
Kevin Stephen
Aye hahaha i'm with you on that
Mar 14, 2016 3:21pm
Ally Toolan
Haha at this point I'm not 100% sure I still researching/deciding to do but I know for sure that I do not support bigoted assholes who think they can do/say whatever they want because they're rich
Mar 14, 2016 3:21pm
Kevin Stephen
who are you supporting/voting for?
Mar 14, 2016 3:18pm
Kevin Stephen

Kevin Stephen
Do you have Skype?
Mar 16, 2014 1:02am
Kevin Stephen
Haha our teacher doesn't explain anything! I still love her tho because she's the MUNYAG director
Mar 16, 2014 1:02am
Kevin Stephen
Nah I'm exaggerating. But like it's true we had to draw a whole bunch of these diagrams on the computer and I got points off because my computer model wasn't "realistic looking enough" lol
Mar 16, 2014 1:01am
Ally Toolan
What!! Thats insane! My teacher just doesn't explain some things clearly
Mar 16, 2014 1:00am
Kevin Stephen
Especially if your teacher is psychotic and thinks you're off by like two degrees and deducts points...
Mar 16, 2014 12:59am
Kevin Stephen
Ohh ok we just did that last chapter. That stuff can get tricky
Mar 16, 2014 12:59am
Ally Toolan
I think we did all that.. were on molecular shapes and like vsepr laws and stuff
Mar 16, 2014 12:58am
Kevin Stephen
Are you on like moles and mass and stuff?
Mar 16, 2014 12:57am
Kevin Stephen
Hmm I guess not...
Mar 16, 2014 12:56am
Ally Toolan
Wut..
Mar 16, 2014 12:54am
Kevin Stephen
Are you on gas laws?
Mar 16, 2014 12:50am

Mar 16, 2014 12:50am
Kevin Stephen

Mar 16, 2014 12:49am
Ally Toolan
I have no idea
Mar 16, 2014 12:49am
Kevin Stephen
Ouch....what are you learning in chem
Mar 16, 2014 12:47am
Ally Toolan
It is my hardest class.. I once took a test where I thought I was gonna know most of it and I literally knew five answers and guessed rhe rest
Mar 16, 2014 12:47am
Kevin Stephen
I guarantee you our chem class is worse....like nobody understands what's going on. For most guys it's one of their hardest classes
Mar 16, 2014 12:44am
Ally Toolan
No.. in my class..
Mar 16, 2014 12:42am
Kevin Stephen
You take the science league tests?
Mar 16, 2014 12:39am
Ally Toolan
I literally dont know what im doing half the time and youre #4 in the Franken state!
Mar 16, 2014 12:39am
Ally Toolan
I hate you both..
Mar 16, 2014 12:38am
Kevin Stephen
Did you know Taras and I as of last month were #4 in the state for chem 1 science league?
Mar 16, 2014 12:36am
Kevin Stephen
Haha speaking of humility
Mar 16, 2014 12:36am
Ally Toolan
Well duh!
Mar 16, 2014 12:35am
Kevin Stephen
Now you see where I get my modesty from
Mar 16, 2014 12:30am
Ally Toolan
There are always perks to knowing me
Mar 16, 2014 12:30am
Kevin Stephen
Also there were def perks of going to school with you
Mar 16, 2014 12:28am
Ally Toolan
That's why we have yearbooks my friend
Mar 16, 2014 12:28am
Kevin Stephen
You're right - I'm just a very nostalgic-type person
Mar 16, 2014 12:27am
Ally Toolan
It was simpler but simple doesnt always equal better
Mar 16, 2014 12:27am
Kevin Stephen
Truth
Mar 16, 2014 12:26am
Ally Toolan
Add modest to that list
Mar 16, 2014 12:26am
Kevin Stephen
At the same time though, life is a lot more complicated. I never had to worry about college, my GPA, becoming valedictorian/salutatorian, staying up late to study for college courses, or running 40-50 miles a week. Life was much simpler back then, even if I wasn't nearly as smart/athletic/cool
Mar 16, 2014 12:25am
Kevin Stephen
I mean yeah I like St. Joe's - it's the only catholic high school in the state that would give me this level of competition and opportunity. With MUN/YAG, being on the newspaper, one of the best science league teams in the state, cross country, track...and because of the way my classes are set up, I have the time/freedom to take 7 AP tests this year - I wouldn't be able to do that anywhere else
Mar 16, 2014 12:24am
Ally Toolan
How bout st joes
Mar 16, 2014 12:21am
Kevin Stephen
Mount sounds like a fun place to be....
Mar 16, 2014 12:21am
Ally Toolan
I like high school I like mount so much better than st Ann's... the uniforms are so much better, I have more freedom, I have a laptop in every class, no logs, no signing every test I like mount
Mar 16, 2014 12:20am
Kevin Stephen
Life was pretty great back in 7th/8th grade
Mar 16, 2014 12:17am
Kevin Stephen
Haha why not?

Mar 27, 2013 10:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Possibly
Mar 27, 2013 10:59pm
Ally Toolan
But it could be just the fact that he was talking to her
Mar 27, 2013 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
But I don't think he would be cuz Connor wasnt really talking to her a lot
Mar 27, 2013 10:58pm
Kevin Stephen
Maybe
Mar 27, 2013 10:57pm
Ally Toolan
You think he's lying so he doesn't look jealous?
Mar 27, 2013 10:57pm
Kevin Stephen
