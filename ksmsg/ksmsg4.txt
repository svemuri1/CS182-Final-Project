Dec 04, 2018 11:38pm
Divya Vatsa
there is literally one year between us
Dec 04, 2018 11:38pm

Dec 04, 2018 11:38pm
Divya Vatsa
relatable content
Dec 04, 2018 11:38pm
Kevin Stephen
and i never catch feelings
Dec 04, 2018 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
i like try my best to avoid hooking up w people even
Dec 04, 2018 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
because i don't let myself get involved with people unnecessarily
Dec 04, 2018 11:37pm
Divya Vatsa
yeah i think you are too
Dec 04, 2018 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
i think
Dec 04, 2018 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
so this is why i'm so emotionally stable
Dec 04, 2018 11:37pm
Divya Vatsa
i am dead
Dec 04, 2018 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
literally my entire adult life lol
Dec 04, 2018 11:37pm
Divya Vatsa
FACTS
Dec 04, 2018 11:36pm
Kevin Stephen
whereas i gave it literally like 2.5 years
Dec 04, 2018 11:36pm
Divya Vatsa
like when you don't address your emotions properly it becomes overwhelming
Dec 04, 2018 11:36pm
Divya Vatsa
i think you're right that she never really gave closure to whatever feelings she had for other people
Dec 04, 2018 11:36pm
Divya Vatsa
while she's definitely only into you know
Dec 04, 2018 11:36pm
Divya Vatsa
like here's the thing
Dec 04, 2018 11:36pm
Divya Vatsa
no i don't think it's judgemental
Dec 04, 2018 11:35pm
Divya Vatsa
ok back to this
Dec 04, 2018 11:35pm
Divya Vatsa
side: akash has a cute cough
Dec 04, 2018 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen
not sure if i'm being judgmental
Dec 04, 2018 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen
i don't know
Dec 04, 2018 11:35pm
Kevin Stephen
but all of this made me really uncomfortable
Dec 04, 2018 11:35pm
Divya Vatsa
wow
Dec 04, 2018 11:34pm
Divya Vatsa
wow okay that explains so much now
Dec 04, 2018 11:34pm
Kevin Stephen
which like i'm more than glad to be supportive and loving but this is also hard for me
Dec 04, 2018 11:34pm
Kevin Stephen
and i have to deal with the brunt of that
Dec 04, 2018 11:34pm
Kevin Stephen
so like I fear that the reason she's having all these emotional issues is because she hasn't taken time by herself to sort out all her feelings
Dec 04, 2018 11:34pm
Kevin Stephen
I'm preffing filmi
Dec 04, 2018 11:33pm
Divya Vatsa
I AM SO CONFUSED
Dec 04, 2018 11:32pm
Divya Vatsa

Dec 04, 2018 11:32pm
Divya Vatsa
THIS IS ALL NEWS TO ME
Dec 04, 2018 11:32pm
Kevin Stephen
but also he became really sad because literally the weekend she left Paris for London she hooked up with someone else
Dec 04, 2018 11:32pm
Divya Vatsa
ohhhhh
Dec 04, 2018 11:32pm

Kevin Stephen

Dec 04, 2018 11:31pm
Kevin Stephen
and i wouldn't want to hurt her
Dec 04, 2018 11:31pm
Divya Vatsa
Wow did not know that
Dec 04, 2018 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
whereas i literally stopped seeing Sabrina partly because i was like wait i think i like sanika
Dec 04, 2018 11:30pm
Divya Vatsa
What
Dec 04, 2018 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
like even when we were seriously talking over the summer she was seeing someone else
Dec 04, 2018 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
because
Dec 04, 2018 11:30pm
Divya Vatsa
Valid
Dec 04, 2018 11:30pm
Kevin Stephen
i don't want to hear about this this makes me really uncomfortable lol
Dec 04, 2018 11:30pm

Divya Vatsa
No if he burden of having to rectify certain issues that don’t really seem your fault
Dec 04, 2018 11:29pm
Kevin Stephen
this is kind of a burden though
Dec 04, 2018 11:29pm
Kevin Stephen
i mean
Dec 04, 2018 11:29pm
Divya Vatsa
wow that came out wrong
Dec 04, 2018 11:29pm
Divya Vatsa
NOT THAT SANIKA IS A BURDEN
Dec 04, 2018 11:29pm
Divya Vatsa
WAIT
Dec 04, 2018 11:29pm
Divya Vatsa
And that he thinks the dynamics of this relationship arent as healthy yet as they should be
Dec 04, 2018 11:28pm
Kevin Stephen
oh wow
Dec 04, 2018 11:28pm
Divya Vatsa
Oh lol just that he feels kind of bad for the burden that you’ve taken on

Laplace smoothing
Dec 04, 2018 11:28pm
Divya Vatsa
I just think that over winter break you guys need to smooth things over if this is going to be a healthy relationship for both of you
Dec 04, 2018 11:27pm
Divya Vatsa
Yeah exactly
Dec 04, 2018 11:27pm
Kevin Stephen

Dec 04, 2018 11:27pm
Divya Vatsa
Yeah I was like lmao Kevin tells like 5 people max about his problems
Dec 04, 2018 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
wonder how she spun that one!
Dec 04, 2018 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
classic
Dec 04, 2018 11:26pm
Divya Vatsa
And she was telling Ajay about formal night
Dec 04, 2018 11:26pm
Kevin Stephen
yup
Dec 04, 2018 11:26pm
Divya Vatsa
And she turns to a lot of people
Dec 04, 2018 11:26pm
Divya Vatsa
But her coping mechanisms are very different
Dec 04, 2018 11:26pm
Divya Vatsa
No I know that. Like she’s been through weird things for sure
Dec 04, 2018 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
but now that i have to deal with too
Dec 04, 2018 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
i think it's like actual emotional issues that she's dealing with
Dec 04, 2018 11:25pm
Divya Vatsa
That was kind of what we were talking about
Dec 04, 2018 11:25pm
Divya Vatsa
No no we are both very aware
Dec 04, 2018 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
and very often sad
Dec 04, 2018 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
and she is like all over the place truly
Dec 04, 2018 11:25pm
Kevin Stephen
and usually unemotional
Dec 04, 2018 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
i am a very regular and easygoing person
Dec 04, 2018 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
i feel like i don't make it happen though
Dec 04, 2018 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen
i know
Dec 04, 2018 11:24pm
Divya Vatsa
but like this shouldn't be happening as much as it does
Dec 04, 2018 11:24pm
Divya Vatsa
hahahah no it's nothing you don't know
Dec 04, 2018 11:24pm
Kevin Stephen

Dec 04, 2018 11:23pm
Kevin Stephen

Dec 04, 2018 11:23pm
Divya Vatsa
wait you know how ajay and i were talking today
Dec 04, 2018 11:23pm
Kevin Stephen
or like i smoothed it over in person in a nice way
Dec 04, 2018 11:23pm
Divya Vatsa
I'M RATTLED
Dec 04, 2018 11:23pm
Kevin Stephen
yes
Dec 04, 2018 11:23pm
Divya Vatsa
that's where you left it?
Dec 04, 2018 11:23pm
Kevin Stephen
is that not wild
Dec 04, 2018 11:22pm
Kevin Stephen
we can talk tomorrow
Dec 04, 2018 11:22pm
Kevin Stephen
so i said
Dec 04, 2018 11:22pm
Kevin Stephen
can you give me like half an hour you literally asked what is wrong
Dec 04, 2018 11:22pm
Kevin Stephen
but then later she texted me saying
Dec 04, 2018 11:22pm
Kevin Stephen
so i was like ok let me study now and we can talk tomorrow after my exams?
Dec 04, 2018 11:22pm
Kevin Stephen
but then she's like ok do you actually want to talk about it or do you want to study
Dec 04, 2018 11:21pm
Kevin Stephen
and then finally i'm like ok what's wrong why are you sad
Dec 04, 2018 11:21pm
Kevin Stephen
so i try to ignore
Dec 04, 2018 11:21pm
Kevin Stephen
and can once again literally see like tears stumbling down her face
Dec 04, 2018 11:21pm
Kevin Stephen
and i'm working hard
Dec 04, 2018 11:21pm
Kevin Stephen
and we were in a cubby here on the third floor
Dec 04, 2018 11:21pm
Kevin Stephen
again for me to work
Dec 04, 2018 11:20pm
Kevin Stephen
so then after lunch and my hindi section we went to lamont
Dec 04, 2018 11:20pm
Kevin Stephen
but i'm like no i did not agree to talk to her about anything, i literally have zero spare time for this conversation, this needs to happen later
Dec 04, 2018 11:20pm
Kevin Stephen
we have very thin walls!
Dec 04, 2018 11:20pm
Kevin Stephen
and i can literally hear her crying/sniffling through the wall
Dec 04, 2018 11:19pm
Kevin Stephen
so then she goes into my bathroom
Dec 04, 2018 11:19pm
Kevin Stephen
but i am thinking no i refuse to engage with this sadness i really need to work
Dec 04, 2018 11:19pm
Kevin Stephen
but like sanika is extraordinarily bad at hiding her emotions
Dec 04, 2018 11:19pm
Kevin Stephen
so she walked me back to prescott and then sat on my sofa while i worked before lunch\
Dec 04, 2018 11:19pm
Kevin Stephen
except i do have to get back to my room and grind for math
Dec 04, 2018 11:18pm
Kevin Stephen
so i said yes of course i'd be glad to see you
Dec 04, 2018 11:18pm
Kevin Stephen
i was in class this morning and sanika texted me asking if she could walk me home bc she also has class at the same time in cgis
Dec 04, 2018 11:18pm
Kevin Stephen
ok i will say this in 30 seconds
Dec 04, 2018 11:18pm

Divya Vatsa

Dec 04, 2018 9:52pm
Divya Vatsa

Dec 04, 2018 9:52pm
Divya Vatsa

Dec 04, 2018 9:52pm
Kevin Stephen
Yes you look stressed but you totally shouldn’t be
Dec 04, 2018 9:51pm
Divya Vatsa
because like two days ago i was feeling really good
Dec 04, 2018 9:51pm
Divya Vatsa
i think i just psyched myself out today
Dec 04, 2018 9:51pm
Kevin Stephen
you should also feel not bad about them
Dec 04, 2018 9:46pm
Kevin Stephen

Oct 31, 2018 8:36pm
Kevin Stephen
the onus is always on me to communicate
Oct 31, 2018 8:36pm
Kevin Stephen
the worst part of all this is NO ONE ever follows up with me
Oct 31, 2018 8:36pm
Kevin Stephen
so i need to wait even longer for my actual computer to arrive while this macbook sits in my room for a week useless
Oct 31, 2018 8:35pm
Kevin Stephen
and then they said the computer im getting tomorrow has the wrong specs
Oct 31, 2018 8:35pm
Kevin Stephen
but finally agreed to remove the charge
Oct 31, 2018 8:35pm
Kevin Stephen
and they put me on hold for like an hour
Oct 31, 2018 8:35pm
Kevin Stephen

Oct 19, 2018 4:21pm
Kevin Stephen
which i did
Oct 19, 2018 4:21pm
Kevin Stephen
this is like me comparing myself to taras
Oct 19, 2018 4:21pm
Kevin Stephen
comparing yourself to sruthi = useless content
Oct 19, 2018 4:21pm
Kevin Stephen
like i said
Oct 19, 2018 4:20pm
Kevin Stephen
this is not true
Oct 19, 2018 4:20pm
Divya Vatsa

Oct 19, 2018 4:11pm
Kevin Stephen
i've seen so many bad canva posters

Kevin Stephen

Oct 19, 2018 4:11pm
Divya Vatsa
even on that people can go soooo wrong
Oct 19, 2018 4:11pm
Kevin Stephen
thank you
Oct 19, 2018 4:11pm
Divya Vatsa

Oct 19, 2018 4:10pm
Kevin Stephen
time efficiency ok
Oct 19, 2018 4:10pm
Divya Vatsa

Divya Vatsa

Oct 19, 2018 4:10pm
Kevin Stephen
so little trust in my graphic design skills
Oct 19, 2018 4:10pm
Kevin Stephen

Oct 19, 2018 4:09pm
Kevin Stephen
no i know hahaha i'm totally kidding
Oct 19, 2018 4:06pm
Divya Vatsa
you are definitely a close friend for her
Oct 19, 2018 4:04pm
Divya Vatsa
fake news
Oct 19, 2018 4:04pm
Kevin Stephen
i kid
Oct 19, 2018 4:04pm
Kevin Stephen
she is just using me for my photographic skills
Oct 19, 2018 4:04pm
Divya Vatsa
which is fine
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Divya Vatsa
like she's sweet but idt she wants to get close to me
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Kevin Stephen
she doesn't really open up
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Kevin Stephen
fair
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Divya Vatsa
sruthi is good but i highkey don't know a single thing about her life
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Divya Vatsa
hahahahaha i am deceased
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Kevin Stephen
!
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Kevin Stephen
unfortunately i'm dating her sophomore counterpart
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Kevin Stephen
but i could never date her
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Kevin Stephen
i mean she's a great person
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Divya Vatsa
so i do think she's a good person
Oct 19, 2018 4:03pm
Divya Vatsa
and like clearly she's so well liked by so many people
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Divya Vatsa
i have just had a hard time reconciling her approach
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Divya Vatsa
no shade to her
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Kevin Stephen
loooooool
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Divya Vatsa
hahahahahhaha
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Divya Vatsa
like networking w people all the time
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Kevin Stephen
are you refering @sruthi
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Divya Vatsa
and people gravitate towards that
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Kevin Stephen
how do you seek out clout
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Divya Vatsa
he just grinded and was a good person
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Divya Vatsa
he never sought it out
Oct 19, 2018 4:02pm
Divya Vatsa
forced is maybe the wrong word. but like when you actively have to seek it out
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen
what do you mean forced
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen
right
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Divya Vatsa
"forced"
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Divya Vatsa
not the forced clout
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Divya Vatsa
that's the type of clout i want
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen
yes
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Divya Vatsa
also you know how like raj has major clout on this campus
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen
i had a really good academic workflow starting sophomore spring
😍Divya Vatsa
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Divya Vatsa
hahahahahhah
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen
but in other ways definitely not
Oct 19, 2018 4:01pm
Kevin Stephen
in some ways yes
Oct 19, 2018 4:00pm
Divya Vatsa
that is interesting and makes sense
Oct 19, 2018 4:00pm
Kevin Stephen
do i want to become more like sanika
Oct 19, 2018 4:00pm
Kevin Stephen
so
Oct 19, 2018 4:00pm
Kevin Stephen
both people in a relationship will eventually average out based on each other's characteristics
Oct 19, 2018 4:00pm
Kevin Stephen
but yeah i firmly believe that
Oct 19, 2018 4:00pm
Divya Vatsa
i am not dating anyone for a longggggg time
Oct 19, 2018 4:00pm
Divya Vatsa
true like being social is not bad but it needs to balanced
Oct 19, 2018 3:59pm
Kevin Stephen
ok look at this
Oct 19, 2018 3:59pm
Kevin Stephen
which is hard with hard classes
Oct 19, 2018 3:59pm
Kevin Stephen
but i have to pull my own academic weight
Oct 19, 2018 3:59pm
Kevin Stephen
like far more than last year
Oct 19, 2018 3:59pm
Kevin Stephen
more social person
Oct 19, 2018 3:59pm
Kevin Stephen
i think i've become like a
Oct 19, 2018 3:59pm
Divya Vatsa
at least this is what raj constantly tells me
Oct 19, 2018 3:59pm
Divya Vatsa
including maintaining academic success
Oct 19, 2018 3:58pm
Divya Vatsa
relationships should improve you in all aspects highkey
Oct 19, 2018 3:58pm
Divya Vatsa
i think that is a fare point
Oct 19, 2018 3:58pm
Kevin Stephen
if this is actually having a negative impact on my grades halfway through term i will have to seek an exit strategy
Oct 19, 2018 3:58pm
Kevin Stephen
kya kare
Oct 19, 2018 3:58pm
Kevin Stephen
but yeah
Oct 19, 2018 3:57pm
Divya Vatsa
ok fair fair
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Kevin Stephen
pls
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Kevin Stephen
what i've organized this whole party from this desk
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Divya Vatsa
instead here we are wasting even more time
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Divya Vatsa
lmaoooooooo
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Kevin Stephen
binders full of work
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Kevin Stephen
i was like no i literally have buckets of work
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Kevin Stephen
no like just now she was like "hey let's go for a walk by the river it's so nice"
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Divya Vatsa
oh my lort
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Kevin Stephen
!
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Kevin Stephen
lol
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Divya Vatsa
hahahahhahahaha
Oct 19, 2018 3:56pm
Divya Vatsa
wait that is kinda really problematic
Oct 19, 2018 3:55pm
Kevin Stephen
but that is a completely different problem haha
Oct 19, 2018 3:55pm
Divya Vatsa
which is different than how i approach, but i shouldn't get upset about it
Oct 19, 2018 3:55pm
Kevin Stephen
tbh i'm kind of afraid that it's having a negative effect on me/my workflow and that's a big red flag for me in this relationship
Oct 19, 2018 3:55pm
Divya Vatsa
which is i guess just their way of excelling here
Oct 19, 2018 3:55pm
Divya Vatsa
hahahaha yes this is something i have observed about both of them
Oct 19, 2018 3:55pm
Kevin Stephen
doesn't do nearly as much work as socializing
Oct 19, 2018 3:55pm
Kevin Stephen
because she's also someone who like
Oct 19, 2018 3:55pm
Kevin Stephen
this is also something that i've weirdly had to reckon with since starting to date sanika
Oct 19, 2018 3:54pm
Kevin Stephen
kind of all she does on campus is build social clout
Oct 19, 2018 3:54pm
Kevin Stephen
but also just like classic sruthi haha you can't compare yourself to her
Oct 19, 2018 3:54pm
Kevin Stephen
that's super annoying
Oct 19, 2018 3:54pm
Kevin Stephen
yeah i know
Oct 19, 2018 3:53pm
Divya Vatsa
that i don't like
Oct 19, 2018 3:53pm
Divya Vatsa
and then it creates a weird competition
Oct 19, 2018 3:53pm
Divya Vatsa
which is like ok then why did i even audition
Oct 19, 2018 3:53pm
Divya Vatsa
yeah sad also rameen was like oh yeah no she's in eleganza 5 days before results were out
Oct 19, 2018 3:53pm
Kevin Stephen
like eleganza is a perfect example
Oct 19, 2018 3:53pm
Kevin Stephen
also dumb that it spills over into things that SHOULD be based on talent
Oct 19, 2018 3:52pm
Kevin Stephen
it's really dumb
Oct 19, 2018 3:52pm
Kevin Stephen
everything here is decided by connections
Oct 19, 2018 3:52pm
Divya Vatsa
and if they do it's bc of raj
Oct 19, 2018 3:52pm
Kevin Stephen
no i totally get it
Oct 19, 2018 3:52pm
Divya Vatsa
that i can't because people don't know me
Oct 19, 2018 3:52pm
Divya Vatsa
it's just that i want to take part in certain things
Oct 19, 2018 3:52pm
Divya Vatsa
and it's not even that i am concerned about the social clout
Oct 19, 2018 3:51pm
Divya Vatsa
i know that chances of me getting on this campus are extremely low
Oct 19, 2018 3:51pm
Divya Vatsa
but like stuff like this which i'm super excited about
Oct 19, 2018 3:51pm
Divya Vatsa
so i'm glad she's out here repping the South Asian community well
Oct 19, 2018 3:51pm
Divya Vatsa
and a cool person
Oct 19, 2018 3:51pm
Divya Vatsa
like yes she's a great dancer
Oct 19, 2018 3:51pm
Divya Vatsa
but i just really find the culture of social inbreeding (as raj so eloquently puts it) to be really sad and toxic here
Oct 19, 2018 3:51pm
Divya Vatsa
ok so i know that i shouldn't be salty or sad or whatever
Oct 19, 2018 3:50pm

Oct 06, 2018 6:41pm
Divya Vatsa

Kevin Stephen
and honor
Oct 06, 2018 6:41pm
Kevin Stephen
and pride
Oct 06, 2018 6:41pm
Kevin Stephen
just a question of ego
Oct 06, 2018 6:40pm
Divya Vatsa
yeah but i don't think how people think you'd be is important
Oct 06, 2018 6:38pm
Kevin Stephen
that's how i see it
Oct 06, 2018 6:37pm
Kevin Stephen
it's kind of an equalizer for two people of very different experience levels
Oct 06, 2018 6:37pm
Divya Vatsa
this is weird
Oct 06, 2018 6:37pm
Kevin Stephen
especially because she very much IS
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Kevin Stephen
that is kind of an important thing
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Divya Vatsa
why is that an important thing???
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Kevin Stephen
is that not a legitimate concern
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Divya Vatsa
bc who cares
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Kevin Stephen
why
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Divya Vatsa
I AM IRKED
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Divya Vatsa
THAT WAS A REALLY ANNOYING COMMENT
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Kevin Stephen
everyone else thinks i am
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Divya Vatsa
OH MY GOD
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Kevin Stephen

Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Kevin Stephen
more than that
Oct 06, 2018 6:36pm
Kevin Stephen
at hand
Oct 06, 2018 6:35pm
Kevin Stephen
we don't want a morals-compromising situation
Oct 06, 2018 6:35pm
Kevin Stephen
but also
Oct 06, 2018 6:35pm
Divya Vatsa
ok that's why it's a good indicator
Oct 06, 2018 6:35pm
Divya Vatsa
hahahahahhaha
Oct 06, 2018 6:35pm
Kevin Stephen
or like even third base
Oct 06, 2018 6:34pm
Kevin Stephen
i doubt that someone who's used to being physical in a relationship can handle a long term relationship without sex
Oct 06, 2018 6:34pm
Divya Vatsa
for long term
Oct 06, 2018 6:34pm
Divya Vatsa
wait but if she is about it even if you don't then that is a good sign
Oct 06, 2018 6:34pm
Kevin Stephen
ok
Oct 06, 2018 6:34pm
Divya Vatsa
PG CONTENT ONLY
Oct 06, 2018 6:34pm
Kevin Stephen
LOL
Oct 06, 2018 6:34pm
Divya Vatsa
STOP
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
these are all just becoming sex references
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Divya Vatsa
this would be a good indicator
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
wow
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
ok also bad joke
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm

Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Divya Vatsa

Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
ok bad pun
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
retire on top
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
and we will no longer have to worry about this
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
because this means that she will in due time break up with me
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Kevin Stephen
no this is good
Oct 06, 2018 6:33pm
Divya Vatsa
but like what if she reallyyyyyyy wants to?

Kevin Stephen

Oct 06, 2018 6:31pm
Kevin Stephen
i made some shit up about how i exercise which increases my testosterone levels so i definitely have it too
Oct 06, 2018 6:31pm
Divya Vatsa
ok this is a major thing to be discussed in detail between you two
Oct 06, 2018 6:31pm
Divya Vatsa
I AM VERY SHOOK
Oct 06, 2018 6:31pm
Divya Vatsa
I AM SHOOK
Oct 06, 2018 6:31pm
Kevin Stephen
your boy felt level 9 uncomfortable
Oct 06, 2018 6:31pm
Kevin Stephen
sanika literally said she probably has a higher sex drive than i do
Oct 06, 2018 6:30pm
Kevin Stephen
also YESTERDAY
Oct 06, 2018 6:30pm
Kevin Stephen
but also that is important too
Oct 06, 2018 6:30pm
Kevin Stephen
she was like yes i agree
Oct 06, 2018 6:30pm
Kevin Stephen
just now i was like "i appreciate that we're not very physical because i get to appreciate everything else about our relationship"
Oct 06, 2018 6:30pm
Divya Vatsa
really?
Oct 06, 2018 6:29pm
Kevin Stephen
because she thinks this is like important to a relationship
Oct 06, 2018 6:29pm
Kevin Stephen
she's absolutely going to get bored of me
Oct 06, 2018 6:29pm
Kevin Stephen
so
Oct 06, 2018 6:29pm
Kevin Stephen
not just sex
Oct 06, 2018 6:29pm
Kevin Stephen
you're really not supposed to be sexually active in any sense before marriage
Oct 06, 2018 6:29pm
Kevin Stephen
also the thing about catholicism is that
Oct 06, 2018 6:29pm
Kevin Stephen
ok yeah
Oct 06, 2018 6:28pm
Kevin Stephen
anything beyond and including making out
Oct 06, 2018 6:26pm
Divya Vatsa
question: what is hooking up?
Oct 06, 2018 6:25pm
Kevin Stephen
to which i was like oh my god am i really this bad at this
Oct 06, 2018 6:25pm
Kevin Stephen
last night she was like ok here's what you should do next time

Kevin Stephen
and also
Oct 06, 2018 6:25pm
Kevin Stephen
she keeps giving me all these POINTERS
Oct 06, 2018 6:24pm
Kevin Stephen
but i actually feel like sanika is uh mostly unimpressed
Oct 06, 2018 6:24pm
Kevin Stephen
good you don't need experience to be good at any of this! you just need to be smart and respectful
Oct 06, 2018 6:24pm
Kevin Stephen
to which i've been like
Oct 06, 2018 6:23pm
Kevin Stephen
have always given me overwhelmingly positive reviews
Oct 06, 2018 6:23pm
Kevin Stephen
but the people with whom i have
Oct 06, 2018 6:23pm
Kevin Stephen
so i've hooked up with only a small number of people in my young lifetime
Oct 06, 2018 6:23pm

Sep 02, 2018 11:43pm
Kevin Stephen
aman and i are equally tipsy
Sep 02, 2018 11:42pm
Divya Vatsa

Sep 02, 2018 11:38pm
Divya Vatsa
Oh please. Do not worry about that. Ok tbh if your friendship cannot stand not being in the same room that is problem. And I can guarantee you that is not the case
Sep 02, 2018 11:38pm
Kevin Stephen

But yes I can understand that would be nice if he tried a little more
Sep 02, 2018 11:37pm
Divya Vatsa
Yeah but we don’t know what’s going on in his head. For all we know he’s hesitant that you don’t want to be as close to him
Sep 02, 2018 11:37pm
Kevin Stephen
would be nice if harshal put in some effort sometimes
Sep 02, 2018 11:36pm

May 23, 2018 3:38am
Divya Vatsa
What????
May 23, 2018 3:38am
Kevin Stephen
Oh you flirt with everyone
May 23, 2018 3:36am
Divya Vatsa
Oof
May 23, 2018 3:34am
Kevin Stephen
Oh the video isn’t sending
May 23, 2018 3:34am
Divya Vatsa
Oooh like what??
May 23, 2018 3:34am
Divya Vatsa
Lolol we ironically are very flirty w each other but I don’t think it’s anything actually
May 23, 2018 3:34am
Kevin Stephen
We are doing some scenic stuff today
May 23, 2018 3:33am
Divya Vatsa
With who Ethan???
May 23, 2018 3:33am
Kevin Stephen
You are too much Hahahaha
May 23, 2018 3:32am
Kevin Stephen
Is that interest I sniff
May 23, 2018 3:32am
Divya Vatsa
I was w the boys and then Ethan and I were talking for a while
😮Kevin Stephen
May 23, 2018 3:27am
Divya Vatsa
And no I haven’t not yet
May 23, 2018 3:27am
Divya Vatsa
Hahaha okie
May 23, 2018 3:27am
Kevin Stephen
Have you seen Rameen yet
May 23, 2018 3:23am
Kevin Stephen
No I appreciate you keeping me updated
May 23, 2018 3:23am
Kevin Stephen
Hahahaha
May 23, 2018 3:22am
Divya Vatsa
Lololol sorry Idk why I always rant to you
May 23, 2018 3:21am
Divya Vatsa
Also I hung out w Ethan (yardfest boy) today and he’s such a sweet guy. Oof I should just not be interested in anyone. Too much confusion and unnecessary energy
May 23, 2018 3:21am
Divya Vatsa
Yeah idk tbh like Vinay and Neil say that they’ve spent time w him and think he’s a good guy. But Raj is very hesitant about anyone in the owl lol (for good reason). And Oof like the attention is nice hahaha but also may be unnecessary and unproductive. Whatever I guess it’s not that concerning. Just wanted to voice it
May 23, 2018 3:20am
Kevin Stephen
All Harshal and I can give you is like gut-feeling cautionary remarks
May 22, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
If you want good information Rameen will be able to provide
May 22, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Sadhu tells the blockmates very little about his personal life
May 22, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Tbh all our girl knowledge of Sadhu is based on a couple encounters and a lot of gossip from Rameen
May 22, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Or you can just wait to see how it plays out and do nothing
May 22, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Which will be super awkward but will probably get him to stop if that’s your intention
May 22, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
One you can ask him what he’s up to
May 22, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
You could do one of two things
May 22, 2018 10:40pm
Kevin Stephen
Hmm well
May 22, 2018 10:40pm
Divya Vatsa
I think it’s more than that. He’s been giving me a lot of attention. Which would be fine if he was an upstanding guy. But history shows he’s shady w girls and idk
May 22, 2018 4:21pm
Kevin Stephen
If it’s just heart filter snapchats I wouldn’t be too concerned hahaha
May 22, 2018 3:13pm
Kevin Stephen
I’m still not sure what you mean by all this flirtiness
May 22, 2018 3:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Also
May 22, 2018 3:13pm
Kevin Stephen
But I guess I am almost 20 pounds heavier than when I last came to India so it’s a fair remark
😮Divya Vatsa
May 22, 2018 3:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha no I’ve gotten small if anything
May 22, 2018 3:13pm
Divya Vatsa
Also kevvvvvv ok I’m being annoying. But I’m a little nervous w sadhu being so flirty
May 22, 2018 2:15pm
Divya Vatsa
YOU SWOLE AF
😆Kevin Stephen
May 22, 2018 2:14pm
Divya Vatsa
Lololol u not chubby
May 22, 2018 2:14pm
Kevin Stephen
She says I’ve gotten chubby
May 22, 2018 12:03pm
Kevin Stephen
Hahaha my chechi is giving me less food
May 22, 2018 12:03pm
Kevin Stephen
So much that everyone thinks I just learned Malayalam
May 22, 2018 10:53am
Kevin Stephen
Practicing my Malayalam a lot haha I have to speak a lot since I have to speak for my whole family now
May 22, 2018 10:52am
Kevin Stephen

I’m doing a lot of traveling to see everyone
May 22, 2018 10:46am
Kevin Stephen
They are all really good!
May 22, 2018 10:46am
Divya Vatsa
How’s the fam?
May 22, 2018 8:13am
Divya Vatsa
Yeah I agree with you completely. I think it’s a matter of changing our definitions of success from just monetary to include a measure of the number or impact of lives we affect
👍Kevin Stephen
May 22, 2018 8:13am
Kevin Stephen
But I think we have much more agency to change things than we let ourselves think
May 21, 2018 10:52pm
Kevin Stephen
That work could be finance or consulting or medical work or research or anything
May 21, 2018 10:52pm
Kevin Stephen
I just wish people wouldn’t feel so resigned to impactful work
May 21, 2018 10:52pm
Kevin Stephen
Everyone’s just trying to get a job at school, there are very few who can look back and see school, job, research as just training for work that actually improves the world in some way
May 21, 2018 10:52pm
Kevin Stephen
No you’re absolutely right
May 21, 2018 10:46pm
Divya Vatsa
Idk I talked to my friend Tim Im for like two hours one day near the end of school and we both realized the types of dreams that harvard encourages as a school are disheartening. Maybe this is just me. But I feel like those who pursue the noticeably successful things are overly recognized and rewarded. While those students who struggle internally trying to reflect and figure out their purpose at school (and as a result are not outwardly chasing success) are almost looked down upon
May 21, 2018 2:12pm
Divya Vatsa
I also think that’s really sad. I know that I’m a bit of an idealist but sometimes even I feel severely jaded. Especially when reading the stories about the Santa Fe shooting and other events. Like I feel I don’t know what I can DO to actually change anything. But still I aspire
May 21, 2018 2:10pm
Kevin Stephen
I can’t even imagine going through life thinking that
May 21, 2018 11:58am
Kevin Stephen
To kind of reflect on how the average student our age even at our school thinks they have little or no ability to really impact the world in a positive way
May 21, 2018 11:58am
Kevin Stephen
You know it really saddened me this past week
May 21, 2018 11:57am
Kevin Stephen
Agreed
May 21, 2018 11:56am
Divya Vatsa
Either way there are more important things to worry about
May 21, 2018 11:56am
Divya Vatsa
Or maybe it’s not a farce 🤔
May 21, 2018 11:56am
Kevin Stephen
We just keep ourselves amused to distract ourselves from the working realities of everyday life
May 21, 2018 11:47am
Kevin Stephen
But you’re right it is all a farce
May 21, 2018 11:47am
Kevin Stephen
We say the same thing about me and sanika hahah
May 21, 2018 11:41am
Kevin Stephen
You never know
May 21, 2018 11:41am
Divya Vatsa
Trust me when we get back in August sadhu will probs act like he doesn’t know me
May 21, 2018 11:35am
Divya Vatsa
This is a big joke
May 21, 2018 11:35am
Divya Vatsa
Nothing is funny
May 21, 2018 11:34am
Divya Vatsa
Nothing is happening
May 21, 2018 11:34am

But I still think it’s so funny
May 21, 2018 11:29am
Kevin Stephen
I’m not getting involved in this
May 21, 2018 11:29am

May 21, 2018 11:14am
Divya Vatsa
I don’t LIKE him
May 21, 2018 11:13am
Divya Vatsa
NO WE ARE NOT
May 21, 2018 11:13am
Kevin Stephen
Oh pls we are far beyond that point
May 21, 2018 11:12am
Divya Vatsa
No screenshotting is admitting that I think he looks good. And I’m not doing that

May 20, 2018 11:24pm
Divya Vatsa

May 20, 2018 11:22pm
Divya Vatsa
Lol no it’s actually tough though. Taxing on a person
May 20, 2018 11:21pm
Kevin Stephen
It’s a petty thing to be angry about but it always happens
May 20, 2018 11:21pm
Kevin Stephen

Divya Vatsa

May 20, 2018 11:18pm
Kevin Stephen
And they never change for other people
May 20, 2018 11:17pm
Kevin Stephen
People very rarely change
May 20, 2018 11:17pm
Divya Vatsa
But boy better put blood sweat and tears into treating her like a queen and genuinely meaning it until I’m on board
May 20, 2018 11:16pm
Divya Vatsa
On the one hand I believe people can change sometimes when they thoroughly mess up
May 20, 2018 11:15pm
Divya Vatsa
And personally I think Rameen is stronger than this and should realize that she only deserves the best
May 20, 2018 11:15pm
Divya Vatsa
Yeah I think it’s absolutely horrible and manipulative
May 20, 2018 11:15pm
Kevin Stephen
It’s all an act
May 20, 2018 11:13pm
Divya Vatsa
Like if Raj knew that they were a thing again he would flip a table
May 20, 2018 11:13pm
Kevin Stephen
Never trust guys who can switch on and off good guy mode
May 20, 2018 11:13pm
Kevin Stephen
I mean i absolutely don’t trust him
May 20, 2018 11:13pm
Divya Vatsa
Like he’s a great person but when it comes to Rameen I don’t trust him yet
May 20, 2018 11:13pm
Divya Vatsa
Oof I really don’t trust him if imma be completely honest and I told Rameen to be cautious
May 20, 2018 11:13pm
