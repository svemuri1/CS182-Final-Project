THANK YOU
Nov 26, 2018, 5:13 PM
Sreya Vemuri
I will try fixing these
Nov 26, 2018, 5:13 PM
Sreya Vemuri
ahhh ok I get that
Nov 26, 2018, 5:11 PM
Nenya Edjah
if you do it like in the example above, you only need to do it once
Nov 26, 2018, 5:11 PM
Sreya Vemuri
oh ok but only after I fork
Nov 26, 2018, 5:11 PM
Nenya Edjah
in make_child, you should be calling setpgid in the child process and in the parent process
Nov 26, 2018, 5:11 PM
Sreya Vemuri
For the child
Nov 26, 2018, 5:11 PM
Sreya Vemuri
wait so in the make child function do I only need to set pgid once?
Nov 26, 2018, 5:11 PM
Nenya Edjah
```
curr->pid = fork();
if (pgid == 0) {
pgid = curr->pid;
}
setpgid(pid, pgid);
```
Nov 26, 2018, 5:10 PM
Nenya Edjah
so what you could be doing there instead is something like:
Nov 26, 2018, 5:10 PM
Nenya Edjah
in that function, you're calling setpgid before you fork, which doesn't really make sense since you can't set the pgid of a child which doesn't exist yet
Nov 26, 2018, 5:10 PM
Nenya Edjah
you also need to do something similar in your make_child function
Nov 26, 2018, 5:09 PM
Nenya Edjah
```
if (pgid == 0) {
pgid = npid;
}
```
Nov 26, 2018, 5:09 PM
Nenya Edjah
what you should probably be doing instead is something like this:
Nov 26, 2018, 5:09 PM
Nenya Edjah
but in your while loop in that funciton, you're always setting *pgid = npid*
Nov 26, 2018, 5:08 PM
Nenya Edjah
the third issue is that you're not updating the pgid correctly in `run_pipeline`. the *pgid* of all of the processes in the pipeline should be the same as the *pid* of the first process in that pipeline
Nov 26, 2018, 5:08 PM
Nenya Edjah
the second issue is that you're not calling claim_foreground (if you're not in the background) on line 235
Nov 26, 2018, 5:06 PM
Nenya Edjah
this is because you should always be claiming the foreground for the main shell right before you're about to take in a new command.

the `claim_foreground(0)` call in run_pipeline isn't necessary if you have the one in the `main()` while loop, and in fact it's actually wrong to call it if you're running the pipeline in the background
Nov 26, 2018, 5:05 PM
Nenya Edjah
but that should really be outside of that if statement, i.e. right above the `while (waitpid(...))` loop
Nov 26, 2018, 5:04 PM
Nenya Edjah
you had a commented out one in the `if (signal_status == SIGINT)` case at the bottom of your main while loop
Nov 26, 2018, 5:03 PM
Nenya Edjah
the first is that you don't have claim_foreground in the right locations
Nov 26, 2018, 5:03 PM
Nenya Edjah
but i figured out a couple of issues in your code
Nov 26, 2018, 5:02 PM
Nenya Edjah
it's fine
Nov 26, 2018, 5:02 PM

once for parent and once for child
Nov 26, 2018, 4:40 PM
Sreya Vemuri
I set them twice
Nov 26, 2018, 4:40 PM
Sreya Vemuri
I think so
Nov 26, 2018, 4:40 PM
Nenya Edjah
Are you setting pgids correctly?
Nov 26, 2018, 4:40 PM

In the normal?
Nov 26, 2018, 4:40 PM
Nenya Edjah
What tests are failing?
Nov 26, 2018, 4:40 PM
Nenya Edjah
Yeah that's pretty tragic, but you'll probably be fine

It‚Äôs like 80/83 normally and 74/83 on mem leaks
Nov 26, 2018, 4:39 PM

Then I think you could do better
Nov 26, 2018, 4:39 PM
Sreya Vemuri
yeah :(
Nov 26, 2018, 4:39 PM

Is your "best" still failing some tests?
Nov 26, 2018, 4:39 PM

I have done my BEST
Nov 26, 2018, 4:38 PM
Sreya Vemuri
lmao ok
Nov 26, 2018, 4:38 PM
Nenya Edjah
Um, you should try to make it as correct as possible
Nov 26, 2018, 4:37 PM
Sreya Vemuri
or do some of them count for more
Nov 26, 2018, 4:33 PM

Oct 22, 2018, 9:35 AM

integers are 4 bytes long, so in little endian, the bytes that make up 4369 are
0x11 0x11 0x00 0x00
and in big endian, they are
0x00 0x00 0x11 0x11
Oct 22, 2018, 7:38 AM
Nenya Edjah
endianess has to do with the order of the sequence of bytes that make up an integer
Oct 22, 2018, 7:38 AM
Sreya Vemuri
which is 0x1111 in hex
Oct 22, 2018, 12:01 AM
Sreya Vemuri
why does the int 4369 not work
Oct 22, 2018, 12:01 AM
Sreya Vemuri
on the first question where it asked for a value that was the same in big and little endian
Oct 22, 2018, 12:01 AM
