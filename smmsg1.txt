Varun Tekur
thats what you do
Dec 9, 2018, 2:48 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah
Dec 9, 2018, 2:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
and then usleep that amount
Dec 8, 2018, 10:26 PM
Sidharth Menon
just read from the buffer the number of seconds if there's a plus in front
Dec 8, 2018, 10:26 PM
Sidharth Menon
this doesn't work
Dec 8, 2018, 10:26 PM
Sidharth Menon
originally
Dec 8, 2018, 10:26 PM
Varun Tekur
what are you doing to handle phase 4?
Dec 8, 2018, 8:02 PM
Varun Tekur
Yeah thats what you are trying to prevent, could be for many reasons. I'm getting that same error, but its always minutes in to the program
Dec 8, 2018, 8:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
getting this thing 9.359 sec: server returned error: -1 request sent to STOPped server (0.218 sec into STOP period, 1.559 sec remaining)
Dec 8, 2018, 7:09 PM
Sidharth Menon
after a while
Dec 8, 2018, 6:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
i changed it and now it‚Äôll have this like catastrophic error lolll
Dec 8, 2018, 6:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
I think it‚Äôs wrong tho
Dec 8, 2018, 6:49 PM
Varun Tekur
Sometimes that is just due to a slow network
Dec 8, 2018, 6:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
it keeps saying that ‚Äúexpected move at (__, __), you skipped to (__, __)‚Äù
Dec 8, 2018, 6:13 PM
Sidharth Menon
have a little trouble with step 4
Dec 8, 2018, 6:12 PM
Sidharth Menon
yo
Dec 8, 2018, 6:12 PM
Varun Tekur
of course
Dec 8, 2018, 3:11 PM
Sidharth Menon
thanks buddy
Dec 8, 2018, 3:09 PM
Sidharth Menon
that makes sense
Dec 8, 2018, 3:09 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh ok
Dec 8, 2018, 3:09 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah you need to do more stuff to change it to a condition variable in step 3
Dec 8, 2018, 3:04 PM
Sidharth Menon
what the hell lol
Dec 8, 2018, 3:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh
Dec 8, 2018, 3:02 PM
Varun Tekur
and then move that line to the appropriate place earlier in the function
Dec 8, 2018, 3:02 PM
Varun Tekur
that is what signals other threads to continue
Dec 8, 2018, 3:02 PM
Varun Tekur
look at where move_done is set to true
Dec 8, 2018, 3:02 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah I was confused for a while but this step is stupid
Dec 8, 2018, 3:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
pset
Dec 8, 2018, 3:01 PM
Sidharth Menon
do you know what we have to do for this part
Dec 8, 2018, 3:01 PM
Sidharth Menon
hey I‚Äôm a little confused on phase 2
Dec 8, 2018, 3:01 PM
Sidharth Menon
Thanks buddy!! Appreciate it
Nov 28, 2018, 3:16 PM
Varun Tekur
Happy Birthday man!
üëçSidharth Menon
Nov 28, 2018, 2:46 PM
Varun Tekur
calling it a day on this pset
üëçSidharth Menon
Nov 21, 2018, 8:47 PM
Varun Tekur
haha np man I just switched it back
Nov 21, 2018, 8:47 PM
Sidharth Menon
I don‚Äôt want to cause u any problems lolll
Nov 21, 2018, 8:33 PM
Sidharth Menon
that‚Äôs fair lol
Nov 21, 2018, 8:33 PM
Sidharth Menon
right
Nov 21, 2018, 8:32 PM
Varun Tekur
I might just leave it how it was bc it worked fairly well lol
Nov 21, 2018, 8:32 PM
Varun Tekur
generally
Nov 21, 2018, 8:32 PM
Sidharth Menon
or just generally
Nov 21, 2018, 8:32 PM
Sidharth Menon
Does yours fail INTR3 with LSAN stuff
Nov 21, 2018, 8:32 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah I think we are
Nov 21, 2018, 8:32 PM
Sidharth Menon
we might be doing a pretty similar thing
Nov 21, 2018, 8:32 PM
Sidharth Menon
And return the child‚Äôs pid
Nov 21, 2018, 8:31 PM
Sidharth Menon
I set the pgids, then close relevant pipe fds, and then set pid to the child‚Äôs pid
Nov 21, 2018, 8:31 PM
Sidharth Menon
In the parent
Nov 21, 2018, 8:31 PM
Varun Tekur
I think I'm doing basically the same thing
Nov 21, 2018, 8:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
then I exec
Nov 21, 2018, 8:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
then I perform redirects (since these have higher precedence I think)
Nov 21, 2018, 8:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
then I do my forking stuff
Nov 21, 2018, 8:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
In child: I set pid to the child‚Äôs pid. Then i do the same setpgid stuff as u
Nov 21, 2018, 8:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
Then I fork
Nov 21, 2018, 8:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
Then I set up the file descriptors for forking (but I think that‚Äôs just implementation specific)
Nov 21, 2018, 8:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
so basically first I do the same c str stuff as u
Nov 21, 2018, 8:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
I do it a little differently
Nov 21, 2018, 8:29 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah
Nov 21, 2018, 8:27 PM
Sidharth Menon
in make_child, right?
Nov 21, 2018, 8:27 PM
Varun Tekur
is that what you do?
Nov 21, 2018, 8:26 PM
Varun Tekur
Varun sent a photo.

Nov 21, 2018, 8:26 PM
Sidharth Menon
& the rest of child
Nov 21, 2018, 8:26 PM
Sidharth Menon
what does your run look like?
Nov 21, 2018, 8:25 PM
Sidharth Menon
weird
Nov 21, 2018, 8:25 PM
Varun Tekur
lol
Nov 21, 2018, 8:25 PM
Varun Tekur
now my intr3 just broke
Nov 21, 2018, 8:25 PM
Varun Tekur
Varun sent a photo.

Nov 21, 2018, 8:25 PM
Sidharth Menon
and that was the only time it failed
Nov 21, 2018, 8:25 PM
Sidharth Menon
But I‚Äôve run it like 8? Times now
Nov 21, 2018, 8:24 PM
Sidharth Menon
my INTR 5 failed once with leaks
Nov 21, 2018, 8:24 PM
Varun Tekur
wait that messed up my intr3
Nov 21, 2018, 8:23 PM
Varun Tekur
let me check
Nov 21, 2018, 8:23 PM
Sidharth Menon
right exactly
Nov 21, 2018, 8:22 PM
Varun Tekur
not its own
Nov 21, 2018, 8:22 PM
Varun Tekur
bc it needs to actually set the childs pgid
Nov 21, 2018, 8:22 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah that makes sense
Nov 21, 2018, 8:22 PM
Sidharth Menon
The highlighted stuff is the parent‚Äôs stuff
Nov 21, 2018, 8:22 PM
Sidharth Menon
You sent a photo.

Nov 21, 2018, 8:22 PM
Varun Tekur
wait so in the parent, set forkpid, pgid
Nov 21, 2018, 8:21 PM
Sidharth Menon
the point of the race condition is to ensure that the child (the executing process) is part of the group
Nov 21, 2018, 8:20 PM
Sidharth Menon
Since it‚Äôs the child‚Äôs pgid
Nov 21, 2018, 8:20 PM
Sidharth Menon
You should be using forkPid for the parent
Nov 21, 2018, 8:20 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh
Nov 21, 2018, 8:20 PM
Varun Tekur
thats what I'm doing for set pgid
Nov 21, 2018, 8:19 PM
Varun Tekur
Varun sent a photo.

Nov 21, 2018, 8:19 PM
Varun Tekur
it seems like the grading server is really slow
Nov 21, 2018, 8:18 PM
Varun Tekur
sure
Nov 21, 2018, 8:18 PM
Sidharth Menon
I can run it again if you want tho
Nov 21, 2018, 8:18 PM
Sidharth Menon
I was talking about the leak haha
Nov 21, 2018, 8:18 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah I did
Nov 21, 2018, 8:18 PM
Varun Tekur
can you check your leak check output
Nov 21, 2018, 8:17 PM
Varun Tekur
hmm
Nov 21, 2018, 8:17 PM
Sidharth Menon
I haven‚Äôt had an issue with anything failing since we made the fix
Nov 21, 2018, 8:17 PM
Sidharth Menon
No I don‚Äôt think so?
Nov 21, 2018, 8:17 PM
Varun Tekur
My stuff seems to be performing worse on the server. Did you find that as well?
Nov 21, 2018, 8:16 PM
Sidharth Menon
but it‚Äôs not really graded anyways
Nov 21, 2018, 8:16 PM
Sidharth Menon
To figure it out
Nov 21, 2018, 8:16 PM
Sidharth Menon
You can call me if you want
Nov 21, 2018, 8:16 PM
Sidharth Menon
Weird
Nov 21, 2018, 8:16 PM
Varun Tekur
That change didn't end up fixing the bux unfortunately
Nov 21, 2018, 8:07 PM
Varun Tekur
Varun called you.
Duration: 4 minutes
Nov 21, 2018, 7:43 PM
Sidharth Menon
easier to talk through it I think haha
Nov 21, 2018, 7:38 PM
Sidharth Menon
give me a call if you‚Äôre free
Nov 21, 2018, 7:38 PM
Sidharth Menon
Varun missed a call from you.
Nov 21, 2018, 7:38 PM
Varun Tekur
what was the problem
Nov 21, 2018, 7:37 PM
Sidharth Menon
ours was as well
Nov 21, 2018, 7:33 PM
Sidharth Menon
your run is probably slightly wrong
Nov 21, 2018, 7:33 PM
Sidharth Menon
we fixed it
Nov 21, 2018, 7:33 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh interesting
Nov 21, 2018, 7:13 PM
Varun Tekur
I might also do it during reading period when they open up the psets allegedly
Nov 21, 2018, 6:30 PM
Varun Tekur
how long did the extra credit take you?
Nov 21, 2018, 6:30 PM
Varun Tekur
Like the intr5 and pipe5
Nov 21, 2018, 6:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
the TFs say it‚Äôs ok
Nov 21, 2018, 6:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
Looks like the bugs are probably fine
Nov 21, 2018, 6:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
and variables
Nov 21, 2018, 6:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
like the command ‚Äúhistory‚Äù
Nov 21, 2018, 6:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah we just chose easy stuff lol
Nov 21, 2018, 6:27 PM
Varun Tekur
is the extra credit easy to do?
Nov 21, 2018, 6:27 PM
Varun Tekur
Varun called you.
Duration: 5 minutes
Nov 21, 2018, 6:25 PM
Sidharth Menon
Varun missed a call from you.
Nov 21, 2018, 6:15 PM

I'm just saying that
Nov 21, 2018, 4:19 PM
Varun Tekur
Varun sent a photo.

Nov 21, 2018, 4:19 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah I may just mention that it works locally but occasionally fails on server
Nov 21, 2018, 4:17 PM
Sidharth Menon
that‚Äôs wicked smaht
Nov 21, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
Yeah I think that‚Äôs a good call
Nov 21, 2018, 4:06 PM
Varun Tekur
are you going to put something in grading notes about it or nah?
Nov 21, 2018, 3:59 PM
Varun Tekur
not other checks
Nov 21, 2018, 3:54 PM
Varun Tekur
plus its only on Lsan
Nov 21, 2018, 3:54 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah I don't think its worth trying to fix
Nov 21, 2018, 3:54 PM
Sidharth Menon
like wtf does that mean hhahaha
Nov 21, 2018, 3:54 PM
Sidharth Menon
the error message is just like ‚Äúits too slow‚Äù
Nov 21, 2018, 3:54 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah it generally passes
Nov 21, 2018, 3:53 PM
Sidharth Menon
and it passed each time
Nov 21, 2018, 3:53 PM
Sidharth Menon
and I ran it again like 5 times
Nov 21, 2018, 3:53 PM
Sidharth Menon
I have 0 idea how to fix it lol
Nov 21, 2018, 3:53 PM
Sidharth Menon
I mean I guess?
Nov 21, 2018, 3:53 PM
Varun Tekur
are you gonna just leave it?
Nov 21, 2018, 3:52 PM
Sidharth Menon
freaking L
Nov 21, 2018, 3:27 PM
Sidharth Menon
but nah no one has responded
Nov 21, 2018, 3:27 PM
Sidharth Menon
I just woke up lol
Nov 21, 2018, 3:27 PM
Sidharth Menon
I guess it wasn‚Äôt a quick nap
Nov 21, 2018, 3:27 PM
Varun Tekur
any updates on Intr 5
Nov 21, 2018, 3:01 PM
Varun Tekur
haha definitely makes sense
Nov 21, 2018, 11:12 AM
Sidharth Menon
also imma take a quick nap rn haha I took at flight home at like 6:30 am
Nov 21, 2018, 10:49 AM
Sidharth Menon
so weird
Nov 21, 2018, 10:49 AM
Sidharth Menon
weird
Nov 21, 2018, 10:49 AM
Varun Tekur
never
Nov 21, 2018, 10:48 AM
Sidharth Menon
never fails on your VM though?
Nov 21, 2018, 10:48 AM
Sidharth Menon
that‚Äôs interesting
Nov 21, 2018, 10:48 AM
Sidharth Menon
oh what lol
Nov 21, 2018, 10:48 AM
Varun Tekur
it says hello bye 0 instead of hello bye 1
Nov 21, 2018, 10:48 AM
Sidharth Menon
What happens for your pipe 5
Nov 21, 2018, 10:47 AM
Sidharth Menon
I bumped that question
Nov 21, 2018, 10:47 AM
Sidharth Menon
and that they ‚Äúthink they fixed it‚Äù
Nov 21, 2018, 10:47 AM
Sidharth Menon
And a TF said that the grading server has issues
Nov 21, 2018, 10:47 AM
Sidharth Menon
If you scroll down someone said the same thing on Monday
Nov 21, 2018, 10:47 AM
Sidharth Menon
it looks like that -might- be a problem with the grading server
Nov 21, 2018, 10:46 AM
Varun Tekur
someone on piazza was complaining that they didn't make the timeouts reasonable or something
Nov 21, 2018, 10:46 AM
Varun Tekur
yeah that happens sometimes to me too
Nov 21, 2018, 10:46 AM
Sidharth Menon
but i haven't had problems with pipe 5
Nov 21, 2018, 10:12 AM
Sidharth Menon
super weird, INTR5 fails in grading server only with memory sanitization & leak detection with no error code other than "should've passed in 0.150 seconds"
Nov 21, 2018, 10:12 AM
Sidharth Menon
and ok will look at that...will probably do that after I finish cd
Nov 21, 2018, 4:59 AM
Sidharth Menon
I ended up figuring out something for step 8 similar to that
Nov 21, 2018, 4:59 AM
Sidharth Menon
ok let me check
Nov 21, 2018, 4:58 AM
Varun Tekur
the TF said its fine, but idk
Nov 21, 2018, 12:39 AM
Varun Tekur
me and this other kid are getting that
Nov 21, 2018, 12:38 AM
Varun Tekur
also lmk if pipe 5 occasionally fails on the grading server for you
Nov 21, 2018, 12:38 AM
Varun Tekur
do that at the beginning of main
Nov 21, 2018, 12:38 AM
Varun Tekur
reset the global signal, set need prompt equal to true, and print a newline
Nov 21, 2018, 12:38 AM
Sidharth Menon
just like if the global is SIGINT then just reset the global signal thing and continue?
Nov 20, 2018, 11:56 PM
Sidharth Menon
and like next to the shit from the zombie process
Nov 20, 2018, 11:56 PM
Sidharth Menon
and set that to the signal from the signal handler
Nov 20, 2018, 11:55 PM
Sidharth Menon
Do you have a global signal_status
Nov 20, 2018, 11:54 PM
Sidharth Menon
What do you do to make a command line print somethin new
Nov 20, 2018, 11:54 PM
Sidharth Menon
For part 8
Nov 20, 2018, 11:54 PM
Sidharth Menon
also
Nov 20, 2018, 11:54 PM
Varun Tekur
np man
Nov 20, 2018, 10:16 PM
Varun Tekur
exactly
Nov 20, 2018, 10:16 PM
Sidharth Menon
right I get that part I think because you don‚Äôt want parent to do some shit that child doesn‚Äôt receive
Nov 20, 2018, 10:14 PM
Sidharth Menon
thanks dude
Nov 20, 2018, 10:13 PM
Varun Tekur
and you do that in both the parent and the child
Nov 20, 2018, 10:13 PM
Sidharth Menon
that‚Äôs so smart
Nov 20, 2018, 10:13 PM
Sidharth Menon
Holy snap I see
Nov 20, 2018, 10:13 PM
Varun Tekur
you get the correct pgid by passing it into the function. for the first process in a pipeline, you pass 0 in, therefore setting its pgid to its pid. this is setpid(getpid,0) for all other processes in the pipeline, you have to set its pgid to the same thing, which is the pid of the first process. the function returns that, so you save it, and then you pass it in to make child for all subsequent processes in the pipeline
Nov 20, 2018, 10:12 PM
Sidharth Menon
(If pgid is 0 to begin with)
Nov 20, 2018, 10:11 PM
Sidharth Menon
or does that automatically happen if you call setpgid(x, 0)
Nov 20, 2018, 10:11 PM
Sidharth Menon
what about the bs in the hint to do if pgid == 0?
Nov 20, 2018, 10:11 PM
Varun Tekur
if forkpid = 0, you are in the child. you set the pgid of getpid to the correct value. if forkpid is not equal to 0, you are in the parent and you do the same thing
Nov 20, 2018, 10:10 PM
Varun Tekur
lets call this forkpid
Nov 20, 2018, 10:09 PM
Varun Tekur
the fork returns a pid
Nov 20, 2018, 10:09 PM
Varun Tekur
no
Nov 20, 2018, 10:09 PM
Sidharth Menon
Wait maybe that‚Äôs wrong loll that‚Äôs 4 calls?
Nov 20, 2018, 10:08 PM
Sidharth Menon
U set child‚Äôs pid to pgid if pgid != 0, otherwise you give it a new pgid (by calling setpgid(0,0))
Nov 20, 2018, 10:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
in both parent and child
Nov 20, 2018, 10:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
so just checking
Nov 20, 2018, 10:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
ohh I think I get it now haha
Nov 20, 2018, 10:06 PM
Varun Tekur
we all need a break
üòçSidharth Menon
Nov 20, 2018, 10:03 PM
Varun Tekur
lol dude don't worry about it, I am so tired as well
Nov 20, 2018, 10:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
ok sorry lol I‚Äôm super tired that was such a dumb question
Nov 20, 2018, 10:01 PM
Sidharth Menon
LOL
Nov 20, 2018, 9:52 PM
Sidharth Menon
I be dumb to
Nov 20, 2018, 9:52 PM
Sidharth Menon
nvm
Nov 20, 2018, 9:52 PM
Sidharth Menon
*pid of fork
Nov 20, 2018, 9:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
isn‚Äôt that like a kernel thing??
Nov 20, 2018, 9:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
when would the pgid of fork return 0
Nov 20, 2018, 9:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
wait what
Nov 20, 2018, 9:51 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah set the pgid of process (which you can get with getpid) to the correct pgid
Nov 20, 2018, 9:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
the same update in both?
Nov 20, 2018, 9:49 PM
Sidharth Menon
I seeee
Nov 20, 2018, 9:49 PM
Sidharth Menon
oohhh
Nov 20, 2018, 9:49 PM
Varun Tekur
because that indicates if you are in the parent or child
Nov 20, 2018, 9:49 PM
Varun Tekur
no, when the pid returned by fork is 0 or not 0
Nov 20, 2018, 9:48 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah you just need to make sure that the parent and the child are both updates because you don't want to have the parent do something without updated info
Nov 20, 2018, 9:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
when the pid is 0 or the pgid is 0?
Nov 20, 2018, 9:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
but no idea what it actually means lolll
Nov 20, 2018, 9:47 PM
Sidharth Menon
Kind of slept through the race conditions part so I vaguely understand it
Nov 20, 2018, 9:47 PM
Varun Tekur
also I found my bug with list 8 and zombie 2
Nov 20, 2018, 9:47 PM
Varun Tekur
so when the pid is 0 or when it is not 0
Nov 20, 2018, 9:47 PM
Varun Tekur
set it in the child and the parent
Nov 20, 2018, 9:47 PM
Sidharth Menon
in make_child
Nov 20, 2018, 9:46 PM
Sidharth Menon
what does it mean we need to call setpgid at two different points
Nov 20, 2018, 9:46 PM
Sidharth Menon
For sure
Nov 20, 2018, 9:45 PM
Varun Tekur
lmk if you ever get any issues with pipe 5 or list 8 failing occasionally on grading server
Nov 20, 2018, 5:51 PM
Varun Tekur
dude I'm so excited
Nov 20, 2018, 5:50 PM
Sidharth Menon
I definitely couldn‚Äôt handle another month of straight school lolll
Nov 20, 2018, 2:57 PM
Sidharth Menon

Nov 20, 2018, 2:50 PM
Sidharth Menon

Nov 20, 2018, 1:30 PM
Sidharth Menon

Nov 20, 2018, 1:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
Cool
Nov 20, 2018, 1:30 PM
Varun Tekur
I am leaving at like 4 30 but I want to get this done asap
Nov 20, 2018, 1:23 PM
Varun Tekur
I can work right after class
Nov 20, 2018, 1:23 PM
Sidharth Menon
If you‚Äôre still here this afternoon do you wanna work together
Nov 20, 2018, 1:12 PM
Sidharth Menon
When are you going home for break
Nov 20, 2018, 1:11 PM
Varun Tekur
I didn't do way too much yesterday
Nov 20, 2018, 1:07 PM
Varun Tekur
no I'm doing 8
Nov 20, 2018, 1:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
/are you done?
Nov 20, 2018, 1:05 PM
Sidharth Menon
What part are you on?
Nov 20, 2018, 1:05 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah haha
Nov 20, 2018, 1:04 PM
Varun Tekur
so are you on redirection now?
Nov 20, 2018, 11:29 AM
Varun Tekur
haha nice
Nov 20, 2018, 11:29 AM
Sidharth Menon
Just kidding LMAO figured it out
Nov 20, 2018, 3:55 AM
Sidharth Menon
I‚Äôve tried everything LMAO
Nov 20, 2018, 3:45 AM
Sidharth Menon
I feel so dumb
Nov 20, 2018, 3:44 AM
Sidharth Menon
The zombie thing
Nov 20, 2018, 3:44 AM
Sidharth Menon
Dude lol what was the loop condition for part 6
Nov 20, 2018, 3:44 AM
Sidharth Menon
appreciate it
Nov 20, 2018, 3:03 AM
Sidharth Menon
I think I got it
Nov 20, 2018, 3:03 AM
Sidharth Menon
Thanks dude
Nov 20, 2018, 3:03 AM
Varun Tekur
this diagram may help
Nov 20, 2018, 1:50 AM
Varun Tekur
Varun sent a photo.

Nov 20, 2018, 1:50 AM
Varun Tekur
first and last pipes are handled slightly differently than middle ones
Nov 20, 2018, 1:50 AM
Varun Tekur
and so on and so forth
Nov 20, 2018, 1:49 AM
Varun Tekur
then you create a new pipe and set stdout to be the write fd of the new pipe
Nov 20, 2018, 1:49 AM
Varun Tekur
meaning set stdin to the old read fd using dup2
Nov 20, 2018, 1:49 AM
Varun Tekur
you basically need to save the read file descriptior of the pipe created in the previous process and connect that to the next process
Nov 20, 2018, 1:48 AM
Varun Tekur
but then you need to generalize the process for many pipes
Nov 20, 2018, 1:48 AM
Varun Tekur
that shows how to do a pipe b
Nov 20, 2018, 1:47 AM
Varun Tekur
for pipes I would recommend looking at shell lecture notes 2
Nov 20, 2018, 1:47 AM
Sidharth Menon
*pipes
Nov 20, 2018, 1:47 AM
Sidharth Menon
Popes
Nov 20, 2018, 1:47 AM
Varun Tekur
or for redirections
Nov 20, 2018, 12:52 AM
Varun Tekur
is this for pipes
Nov 20, 2018, 12:52 AM
Sidharth Menon
do you have to store the previous file‚Äôs file descriptors
Nov 20, 2018, 12:36 AM
Sidharth Menon
*stdin
Nov 20, 2018, 12:19 AM
Sidharth Menon
how do u access the stdout of another process
Nov 20, 2018, 12:19 AM
Varun Tekur
yeah I did it in run
Nov 19, 2018, 11:31 PM
Sidharth Menon
or did you do that in eval_line
Nov 19, 2018, 5:44 PM
Sidharth Menon
did you do that in run?
Nov 19, 2018, 5:43 PM
Sidharth Menon
let me give that a crack
Nov 19, 2018, 5:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
oh interesting
Nov 19, 2018, 5:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
we didn‚Äôt do that so it‚Äôs an issue lol
Nov 19, 2018, 5:40 PM
Varun Tekur
I think after running each conditional I exit the child process
Nov 19, 2018, 5:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
ok that would make sense
Nov 19, 2018, 5:40 PM
Varun Tekur
i remember exiting somewhere
Nov 19, 2018, 5:39 PM
Sidharth Menon
do you exit the parent process after forking for background stuff?
Nov 19, 2018, 5:36 PM
Sidharth Menon
We just realized we have a bug from like step 2 maybe?
Nov 19, 2018, 5:36 PM
Sidharth Menon
question
Nov 19, 2018, 5:36 PM
Sidharth Menon
Nice
Nov 19, 2018, 12:08 PM
Sidharth Menon
üò§üò§
Nov 19, 2018, 12:07 PM
Varun Tekur
I'm on 7 and at office hours rn
Nov 19, 2018, 12:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
how is it for you?
Nov 19, 2018, 12:05 PM
Sidharth Menon
Milan and I are on step 4
Nov 19, 2018, 12:05 PM
Varun Tekur
how has it been going?
Nov 18, 2018, 11:37 PM
Sidharth Menon
lol probably
Nov 18, 2018, 10:02 PM
Varun Tekur
I think its fine
Nov 18, 2018, 10:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
The BG tests do
Nov 18, 2018, 10:02 PM
Varun Tekur
compare it with what the normal shell does
Nov 18, 2018, 10:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
I mean the tests pass I guess
Nov 18, 2018, 10:02 PM
Varun Tekur
does the test pass?
Nov 18, 2018, 10:01 PM
Sidharth Menon
Is that ok/bc other stuff isn‚Äôt implemented yet
Nov 18, 2018, 9:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
(not as if you had called echo or something or printed something)
Nov 18, 2018, 9:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
but if you call sleep 1 & it prints the output right on the old shell prompt
Nov 18, 2018, 9:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
hey so I think? it works
Nov 18, 2018, 9:50 PM
Sidharth Menon
*shot loll
Nov 18, 2018, 9:22 PM
Sidharth Menon
Ok let me give that a shit
Nov 18, 2018, 9:22 PM
Sidharth Menon
Ohhh
Nov 18, 2018, 9:22 PM
Varun Tekur
you get an & when token is token_background in eval line
Nov 18, 2018, 9:22 PM
Sidharth Menon
Ok
Nov 18, 2018, 9:22 PM
Varun Tekur
then, when a process needs to be run in background, fork a process and run it in the forked process. otherwise, run it in normally
Nov 18, 2018, 9:21 PM
Sidharth Menon
How do you know when you get an ‚Äò&‚Äô
Nov 18, 2018, 9:21 PM
Varun Tekur
you need to change eval line to set the is_background flag when necessary
Nov 18, 2018, 9:20 PM
Varun Tekur
ok good
Nov 18, 2018, 9:20 PM
Sidharth Menon
fuck a linked list lol
Nov 18, 2018, 9:19 PM
Varun Tekur
and I may come by at like 1030ish
Nov 18, 2018, 9:19 PM
Sidharth Menon
tree
Nov 18, 2018, 9:19 PM
Varun Tekur
are u using a tree or linked list
Nov 18, 2018, 9:19 PM
Sidharth Menon
feel free to come thru
Nov 18, 2018, 9:17 PM
Sidharth Menon
Milan and I just started in Lowell
Nov 18, 2018, 9:17 PM
Sidharth Menon
For step 2
Nov 18, 2018, 9:17 PM
Sidharth Menon
yo how do you detect control operators
Nov 18, 2018, 9:17 PM
Varun Tekur
definitely use a tree and not a linked list as well
Nov 18, 2018, 7:48 PM
Varun Tekur
haha ok, I'm trying to finish pipes tonight
Nov 18, 2018, 7:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
I met with him earlier to review the stuff from the unit
Nov 18, 2018, 7:47 PM
Sidharth Menon
I‚Äôm meeting Milan st like 8 to work
Nov 18, 2018, 7:46 PM
Sidharth Menon
Lol
Nov 18, 2018, 7:46 PM
Varun Tekur
have you made any progress on the pset?
Nov 18, 2018, 5:21 PM
Varun Tekur
ok sweek lmk
Nov 18, 2018, 1:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
but will let u know soon
Nov 18, 2018, 1:44 PM
Sidharth Menon
idk when specifically
Nov 18, 2018, 1:44 PM
Sidharth Menon
Yeah me and Milan are gonna
Nov 18, 2018, 1:44 PM
Varun Tekur
Are you gonna work on CS today?
Nov 18, 2018, 1:43 PM
Varun Tekur
lmk if you want to work on it whenever you start
Nov 14, 2018, 9:41 PM
Varun Tekur
This is like the worst possible week to have this
Nov 14, 2018, 9:41 PM
Varun Tekur
dude it fing sucks
Nov 14, 2018, 9:41 PM
Sidharth Menon
I haven‚Äôt started it
Nov 14, 2018, 9:39 PM
Sidharth Menon
God damn it lol
Nov 14, 2018, 9:39 PM
Varun Tekur
its like way harder than the others lol
Nov 14, 2018, 9:37 PM
Varun Tekur
Have u started this next pset?
Nov 14, 2018, 7:09 PM
Varun Tekur
the worst part is that after I'm done, I have to comment all of this code üòÇ
Nov 6, 2018, 5:25 PM
Varun Tekur
I might have to go out and take a walk and come back or something
Nov 6, 2018, 5:25 PM
Sidharth Menon
Set it to 1
Nov 6, 2018, 5:23 PM
Sidharth Menon
Lol
Nov 6, 2018, 5:23 PM
Varun Tekur
hopefully it holds up
Nov 6, 2018, 5:22 PM
Varun Tekur
I turned my slowdown constant to 1 and am about to let this sit for a while
Nov 6, 2018, 5:22 PM
Sidharth Menon
and I did my pset with him
Nov 6, 2018, 5:20 PM
Sidharth Menon
Milan did his for an hour and it was ok
Nov 6, 2018, 5:20 PM
Sidharth Menon
I can test mine for longer but I think it‚Äôs fine
Nov 6, 2018, 5:20 PM
Sidharth Menon
Like 5 minutes
Nov 6, 2018, 5:20 PM
Varun Tekur
mine just ran a solid few minutes and was fine but I should probably test a few more times
Nov 6, 2018, 5:20 PM
Varun Tekur
how long did you run yours for?
Nov 6, 2018, 5:19 PM
Sidharth Menon
You: Û∞ÄÄ

Nov 6, 2018, 5:09 PM
Varun Tekur
thanks
Nov 6, 2018, 5:02 PM
Varun Tekur
ok I may text you later today
Nov 6, 2018, 5:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
I think mine works fine now
Nov 6, 2018, 5:01 PM
Sidharth Menon
I‚Äôm happy to talk to you about it lol
Nov 6, 2018, 5:01 PM
Sidharth Menon
Ok lol
Nov 6, 2018, 5:01 PM
Varun Tekur
I've made mine significantly better but now I also have a single memory leak in the top row lol
Nov 6, 2018, 4:48 PM
Varun Tekur
I might hit you up later if you are free
Nov 6, 2018, 4:09 PM
Varun Tekur
nice
Nov 6, 2018, 4:08 PM
Sidharth Menon
I think I forgot a kfree somewhere
Nov 6, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
idk
Nov 6, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
I just rewrote fork and it‚Äôs good now
Nov 6, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
Fixed that memory leak lol
Nov 6, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
Not sure tho
Nov 6, 2018, 12:41 PM
Sidharth Menon
we threw a ptiter in there for the maps (I think)
Nov 6, 2018, 12:41 PM
Sidharth Menon
Uh I think we did?
Nov 6, 2018, 12:40 PM
Varun Tekur
along with kalloc?
Nov 6, 2018, 12:21 PM
Varun Tekur
do you also have to account for the fact that map allocates pages?
Nov 6, 2018, 12:21 PM
Varun Tekur
I was being stupid and using va instead of pa in a place
Nov 6, 2018, 11:53 AM
Varun Tekur
out
Nov 6, 2018, 11:53 AM
Varun Tekur
figured it our
Nov 6, 2018, 11:53 AM
Varun Tekur
so it may not be an exit problem
üëéVarun Tekur
Nov 6, 2018, 11:47 AM
Varun Tekur
this is happening in my normal fork too not just forkexit
Nov 6, 2018, 11:47 AM
Varun Tekur
look
Nov 6, 2018, 11:43 AM
Varun Tekur
ok I'll take a loom
Nov 6, 2018, 11:43 AM
Sidharth Menon
If forknfails
Nov 6, 2018, 11:43 AM
Sidharth Menon
And after two? (I don‚Äôt remember) of the cases in fork
Nov 6, 2018, 11:43 AM
Sidharth Menon
In the free function
Nov 6, 2018, 11:42 AM
Varun Tekur
like just in the free function?
Nov 6, 2018, 11:42 AM
Sidharth Menon
*everywhere
Nov 6, 2018, 11:42 AM
Sidharth Menon
Everuwhere
Nov 6, 2018, 11:42 AM
Sidharth Menon
make sure that you‚Äôre kfreeing the last page table
Nov 6, 2018, 11:42 AM
Sidharth Menon
yeah I had that too
Nov 6, 2018, 11:42 AM
Varun Tekur
just one address
Nov 6, 2018, 11:42 AM
Varun Tekur
no errors, but every time in fork, this one specific spot is always skipped
Nov 6, 2018, 11:42 AM
Sidharth Menon
oh no
Nov 6, 2018, 11:41 AM
Varun Tekur
I think I'm getting a memory leak now
Nov 6, 2018, 11:41 AM
Sidharth Menon
You: Û∞ÄÄ

Nov 6, 2018, 11:38 AM
Varun Tekur
thanks
Nov 6, 2018, 11:38 AM
Varun Tekur
makes sense
Nov 6, 2018, 11:38 AM
Sidharth Menon
no place should be systematically empty
Nov 6, 2018, 11:38 AM
Sidharth Menon
but it should be filled up after
Nov 6, 2018, 11:38 AM
Varun Tekur
yeah
Nov 6, 2018, 11:38 AM
Sidharth Menon
When a process is freed
Nov 6, 2018, 11:38 AM
Sidharth Menon
I mean there can be gaps occasionally
Nov 6, 2018, 11:37 AM
Varun Tekur
like with no gaps?
Nov 6, 2018, 11:37 AM
Sidharth Menon
like it‚Äôs going sequentially
Nov 6, 2018, 11:19 AM
Sidharth Menon
Make sure that it‚Äôs filling in physical memory correctly tho
Nov 6, 2018, 11:19 AM
Sidharth Menon
ya
Nov 6, 2018, 11:19 AM
Varun Tekur
so basically its just supposed to do random stuff forever
Nov 6, 2018, 11:19 AM
Varun Tekur
I think I figured it out
Nov 6, 2018, 11:19 AM
Varun Tekur
awesome thanks so much
Nov 5, 2018, 12:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
easier to explain in person probably
Nov 5, 2018, 12:01 PM
Sidharth Menon
it‚Äôs kind of weird so I‚Äôd be happy to walk you through it
Nov 5, 2018, 12:01 PM
Sidharth Menon
good luck on that
Nov 5, 2018, 12:00 PM
Sidharth Menon
Yeah no problem
Nov 5, 2018, 12:00 PM
Varun Tekur
I have a math midterm tomorrow morning but I may hit you up after that
Nov 5, 2018, 12:00 PM
Varun Tekur
thanks a lot man
Nov 5, 2018, 12:00 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah I did the second part, but I think that makes sense, so I'll give it a try
Nov 5, 2018, 12:00 PM
Sidharth Menon
so u gotta delete that yourself with kfree
Nov 5, 2018, 11:58 AM
Sidharth Menon
ptiter doesn‚Äôt traverse the last page table
Nov 5, 2018, 11:58 AM
Sidharth Menon
This took me awhile
Nov 5, 2018, 11:58 AM
Sidharth Menon
oh AND
Nov 5, 2018, 11:58 AM
Sidharth Menon
And note that map also kallocs additional pages implicitly
Nov 5, 2018, 11:57 AM
Sidharth Menon
right
Nov 5, 2018, 11:56 AM
Varun Tekur
so basically you just have to free the pages returned by kalloc that were never mapped instead of freeing the whole process?
Nov 5, 2018, 11:56 AM
Sidharth Menon
but that‚Äôs the basic idea
Nov 5, 2018, 11:56 AM
Sidharth Menon
I can walk you through it in more depth later if you want
Nov 5, 2018, 11:56 AM
Sidharth Menon
but everything else is mostly ok
Nov 5, 2018, 11:55 AM
Sidharth Menon
you should just stop giving it memory and clean up what you‚Äôve given it (if like map fails or something you need to clean up the memory that map gave it)
Nov 5, 2018, 11:55 AM
Sidharth Menon
You shouldn‚Äôt kill the process
Nov 5, 2018, 11:55 AM
Sidharth Menon
And it doesn‚Äôt work
Nov 5, 2018, 11:54 AM
Sidharth Menon
basically if a process asks for more memory
Nov 5, 2018, 11:54 AM
Sidharth Menon
in the fork case you have to be careful about how much memory you‚Äôre freeing
Nov 5, 2018, 11:54 AM
Varun Tekur
oh shit ok, thats what I have now basically
Nov 5, 2018, 11:54 AM
Sidharth Menon
which was wrong
Nov 5, 2018, 11:54 AM
Sidharth Menon
but we just plugged that in everywhere
Nov 5, 2018, 11:54 AM
Sidharth Menon
we had a function that basically did what system - exit was supposed to do
Nov 5, 2018, 11:54 AM
Sidharth Menon
you have to treat it casewise and be a little more careful
Nov 5, 2018, 11:53 AM
Sidharth Menon
it was with being lazy with the third step (like cleaning up if fork screws up and there‚Äôs not enough memory)
Nov 5, 2018, 11:53 AM
Varun Tekur
what was the problem specifically?
Nov 5, 2018, 11:52 AM
Sidharth Menon
would be happy to help you at any time
Nov 5, 2018, 11:52 AM
Sidharth Menon
yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure my step 7 works
Nov 5, 2018, 11:52 AM
Varun Tekur
really?
Nov 5, 2018, 9:21 AM
Sidharth Menon
he had a stroke of genius
Nov 5, 2018, 2:18 AM
Sidharth Menon
Milan and I finished it
Nov 5, 2018, 2:18 AM
Varun Tekur
and then messes up
Nov 4, 2018, 11:45 PM
Varun Tekur
Yes
Nov 4, 2018, 11:45 PM
Sidharth Menon
Does it run for like 30 seconds for you too
Nov 4, 2018, 11:45 PM
Varun Tekur
ugh
Nov 4, 2018, 11:45 PM
Sidharth Menon
exact same thing
Nov 4, 2018, 11:45 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah haha
Nov 4, 2018, 11:45 PM
Varun Tekur
does it also have that kernel user error
Nov 4, 2018, 11:45 PM
Varun Tekur
devastating
Nov 4, 2018, 11:44 PM
Sidharth Menon
it be like that sometimes
Nov 4, 2018, 11:33 PM
Sidharth Menon
I have the red stars rn
Nov 4, 2018, 11:33 PM
Sidharth Menon
LOL
Nov 4, 2018, 11:33 PM
Varun Tekur
and also if you ever see red stars with white background in the virtual memory
Nov 4, 2018, 10:58 PM
Varun Tekur
lmk if you ever end up getting the error that I'm getting
Nov 4, 2018, 10:57 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah set the owner to 0 when the counter is 0
Nov 4, 2018, 10:22 PM
Sidharth Menon
and set the owner to 0
Nov 4, 2018, 10:22 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah I did the same thing
Nov 4, 2018, 10:22 PM
Sidharth Menon
we just decremented a counter for shared pages
Nov 4, 2018, 10:21 PM
Sidharth Menon
what did you do for kfree?
Nov 4, 2018, 10:21 PM
Sidharth Menon
wait we just got a ‚ÄúUnexpected exception 13!‚Äù
Nov 4, 2018, 10:14 PM
Sidharth Menon
nah it‚Äôs just undefined behavior lol
Nov 4, 2018, 10:14 PM
Sidharth Menon
oh shit
Nov 4, 2018, 10:14 PM
Varun Tekur
does yours display any error messages?
Nov 4, 2018, 10:13 PM
Varun Tekur
and then sometimes, the entire thing just decides to restart
Nov 4, 2018, 10:13 PM

I'm getting "Kernel allocated page mapped for user"

%rip
Nov 4, 2018, 10:12 PM
Sidharth Menon
the operating system just crashes lol
Nov 4, 2018, 10:12 PM
Varun Tekur
What error are you getting?
Nov 4, 2018, 10:12 PM
Sidharth Menon
it really is
Nov 4, 2018, 10:12 PM
Sidharth Menon
Yeah I‚Äôm on step 7 rn
Nov 4, 2018, 10:12 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh shit lmao
Nov 4, 2018, 10:12 PM
Varun Tekur
step 7 is really a process
Nov 4, 2018, 10:12 PM
Varun Tekur
I figured out that error but some other stuff came up as well
Nov 4, 2018, 10:11 PM
Sidharth Menon
I‚Äôll let u know if we run in to them
Nov 4, 2018, 12:54 PM
Sidharth Menon
No I don‚Äôt think so?
Nov 4, 2018, 12:54 PM
Varun Tekur
do you ever specifically remember having any problems with page faults at the address 0xb8f00?
Nov 4, 2018, 11:53 AM
Sidharth Menon
Oh ok will do haha
Nov 4, 2018, 11:09 AM
Varun Tekur
it possibly caused problems in step 7
Nov 3, 2018, 11:30 PM
Varun Tekur
also, never use set_pagetable
Nov 3, 2018, 11:30 PM
Varun Tekur
Np man
Nov 3, 2018, 11:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
just figured it out haha thanks my dude
Nov 3, 2018, 5:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
*try
Nov 3, 2018, 5:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
Let me give that a turn
Nov 3, 2018, 5:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
I forgot about the system call part
Nov 3, 2018, 5:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
Uhhh
Nov 3, 2018, 5:47 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh shit my bad
Nov 3, 2018, 5:47 PM
Varun Tekur
There is also a lot of really good stuff on piazza so check that out
Nov 3, 2018, 5:47 PM
Varun Tekur
I have to head out really soon for a thing at 6 but I can message you later
Nov 3, 2018, 5:47 PM
Sidharth Menon
Varun missed a call from you.
Nov 3, 2018, 5:46 PM
Varun Tekur
and then you have to change the sys page alloc system call to use the new pagetable you just created for process allocs
Nov 3, 2018, 5:44 PM
Varun Tekur
just create a new pagetable, make the pagetabe in ptable for that process equal to it, and then do mappings with that new pagetable
Nov 3, 2018, 5:43 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh ok haha
Nov 3, 2018, 5:42 PM
Varun Tekur
Actually don't worry about setpagetable for this step
Nov 3, 2018, 5:42 PM
Sidharth Menon
I can‚Äôt see that function lol
Nov 3, 2018, 5:41 PM
Sidharth Menon
wait where is setpagetable?
Nov 3, 2018, 5:41 PM
Varun Tekur
Lol basically do all of that in process setup
Nov 3, 2018, 5:41 PM
Sidharth Menon
no wonder
Nov 3, 2018, 5:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
oh shit I‚Äôm doing this completely wrong LOL
Nov 3, 2018, 5:40 PM
Varun Tekur
and make sure the pagetable is also set equal to that, not the kernel one
Nov 3, 2018, 5:40 PM
Varun Tekur
You basically have to make sure that only the kernel memory is mapped, then create a pagetable using kalloc, set the pagetable to that using the setpagetable function, and then map the process stuff using that pagetable
Nov 3, 2018, 5:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
do you just have to do the 2 vmiter map for the kernel mappings & then map after the ‚Äúallocated & map all memory‚Äù part & one vmiter.map after the ‚Äúallocate stack‚Äù part
Nov 3, 2018, 4:09 PM
Sidharth Menon
yo I‚Äôm a little stuck on step 2
Nov 3, 2018, 4:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
oof
Nov 3, 2018, 4:07 PM
Varun Tekur
step 5
Nov 1, 2018, 10:17 PM
Varun Tekur
I'm on fork but I'm having a problem
Nov 1, 2018, 10:17 PM
Sidharth Menon
wbu
Nov 1, 2018, 8:46 PM
Sidharth Menon
I started part 1 but am not done
Nov 1, 2018, 8:46 PM
Sidharth Menon
not really haha
Nov 1, 2018, 8:46 PM
Varun Tekur
Have you started the pset?
Nov 1, 2018, 8:22 PM
Varun Tekur
Haha I'm sure we will both learn from each other
Oct 23, 2018, 12:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
I wanna learn from you haha!
Oct 23, 2018, 12:03 AM
Sidharth Menon
rip
Oct 23, 2018, 12:03 AM
Sidharth Menon
yeah pset 4 supposed to be the hardest one right
Oct 23, 2018, 12:03 AM
Sidharth Menon
you definitely have a lot of natural talent
Oct 23, 2018, 12:02 AM
Varun Tekur
unfortunately its supposedly harder
Oct 23, 2018, 12:02 AM
Sidharth Menon
for sure
Oct 23, 2018, 12:02 AM
Varun Tekur
we can definitely find some time to work together if you want
Oct 23, 2018, 12:02 AM
Sidharth Menon
Hope to repay the favor next pset!
Oct 23, 2018, 12:01 AM
Varun Tekur
on to the next pset
Oct 23, 2018, 12:01 AM
Varun Tekur
np at all man
Oct 23, 2018, 12:01 AM
Sidharth Menon
thanks for all your help dude
Oct 23, 2018, 12:01 AM
Sidharth Menon
honestly doesn‚Äôt really matter lol
Oct 23, 2018, 12:01 AM
Sidharth Menon
possible haha but not likely
Oct 23, 2018, 12:01 AM
Varun Tekur
yeah sure, it could also be variance on different VMs also
Oct 23, 2018, 12:01 AM
Sidharth Menon
but doesn‚Äôt matter I already turned it in hahah
Oct 23, 2018, 12:01 AM
Sidharth Menon
I think I must‚Äôve fed it the wrong flags lol
Oct 23, 2018, 12:00 AM
Sidharth Menon
If we ever get a chance I wanna see what you did with mmap haha
Oct 23, 2018, 12:00 AM
Varun Tekur
similar to what I have
Oct 23, 2018, 12:00 AM
Sidharth Menon
I think it gets the job done
Oct 23, 2018, 12:00 AM
Sidharth Menon
idk it‚Äôs probably fine lol
Oct 23, 2018, 12:00 AM
Varun Tekur
yeah that seems good
Oct 23, 2018, 12:00 AM
Sidharth Menon
And if I lose it‚Äôs like .98 or something like that
Oct 23, 2018, 12:00 AM
Sidharth Menon
oh like 24 beating, 7 losing
Oct 23, 2018, 12:00 AM
Varun Tekur
how many are you usually beating stdio?
Oct 22, 2018, 11:59 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah I mean it boosted performance
Oct 22, 2018, 11:59 PM
Sidharth Menon
idk I probably did mmap in a bad way or used the wrong flags lol
Oct 22, 2018, 11:59 PM
Varun Tekur
thats probably ok then
Oct 22, 2018, 11:59 PM
Sidharth Menon
it‚Äôs similar for sequential but the max is like 19x instead of 70x
Oct 22, 2018, 11:59 PM
Sidharth Menon
I‚Äôm not sure why
Oct 22, 2018, 11:58 PM
Sidharth Menon
hmm I think mine isn‚Äôt as fast
Oct 22, 2018, 11:58 PM
Varun Tekur
basically much faster for all but sequential, and then similar for sequential
Oct 22, 2018, 11:57 PM
Varun Tekur
on average i think the number was like 6.5
Oct 22, 2018, 11:57 PM
Sidharth Menon
how much faster is your implementation as a whole?
Oct 22, 2018, 9:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
mine isn‚Äôt as fast as yours? I think I might‚Äôve done mmap wrong
Oct 22, 2018, 9:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
nvm I figured it out lol
Oct 22, 2018, 9:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
Or is it automatically done when you call munmap in close?
Oct 22, 2018, 9:21 PM
Sidharth Menon
did you have to flush anything
Oct 22, 2018, 9:21 PM
Sidharth Menon
ok haha good to know
Oct 22, 2018, 9:20 PM
Varun Tekur
I don't think I ran into that error
Oct 22, 2018, 9:20 PM
Sidharth Menon
or modify io61_flush?
Oct 22, 2018, 9:18 PM
Sidharth Menon
/did you have to modify io61_open-check
Oct 22, 2018, 9:18 PM
Sidharth Menon
Did you run into an error ‚Äúinput file is not seekabke‚Äù
Oct 22, 2018, 9:17 PM
Varun Tekur
its all good, is it working well?
Oct 22, 2018, 9:17 PM
Sidharth Menon
for mmap
Oct 22, 2018, 9:16 PM
Sidharth Menon
sorry for all of these questions
Oct 22, 2018, 9:16 PM
Sidharth Menon
hey haha
Oct 22, 2018, 9:16 PM
Varun Tekur
np problem man
Oct 22, 2018, 7:27 PM
Sidharth Menon
You‚Äôre the man!
Oct 22, 2018, 4:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
Thanks dude
Oct 22, 2018, 4:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah haha ok
Oct 22, 2018, 4:07 PM
Varun Tekur
and I believe the lecture is storage 3 but not 100 percent sure
Oct 22, 2018, 4:07 PM
Varun Tekur
thats why its so fast lol
Oct 22, 2018, 4:06 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah thats the point, you only need to mmap it once and then you are done
Oct 22, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
that‚Äôs so neat
Oct 22, 2018, 4:06 PM
Varun Tekur
Look at the lecture notes for when we went over mmap to see exactly what parameters to put in and how to error check
Oct 22, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
so you map the whole freaking file?
Oct 22, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
dope haha
Oct 22, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
I didn‚Äôt see that
Oct 22, 2018, 4:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh shit
Oct 22, 2018, 4:06 PM
Varun Tekur
which you can get using the file size function provided at the bottom
Oct 22, 2018, 4:05 PM
Varun Tekur
you set the length for what you want to read as the file size
Oct 22, 2018, 4:05 PM
Sidharth Menon
or is there some special flag for other stuff haha
Oct 22, 2018, 4:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
or whatever we set it as
Oct 22, 2018, 4:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
should we use the length as 4096
Oct 22, 2018, 4:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
in mmap
Oct 22, 2018, 4:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
haha u right
Oct 22, 2018, 4:02 PM
Varun Tekur
so even more generous than high school lol
üëçSidharth Menon
Oct 22, 2018, 3:05 PM
Sidharth Menon
but those typically are like 85-90 or 85-92
Oct 22, 2018, 3:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah because there are A-s as well
Oct 22, 2018, 3:03 PM
Varun Tekur
oh ok, so just like high school grading
Oct 22, 2018, 3:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
in terms of total score not on the midterm I guess haha
Oct 22, 2018, 3:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
Just depends on the professor
Oct 22, 2018, 3:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
sometimes above a 90
Oct 22, 2018, 3:02 PM
Sidharth Menon
normally I think you shoot shoot for like a 92-93 curved
Oct 22, 2018, 3:02 PM
Varun Tekur
I wonder how far above the mean you need to get an A tho
Oct 22, 2018, 2:58 PM
Sidharth Menon
that‚Äôs smaht
Oct 22, 2018, 2:58 PM
Sidharth Menon
word
Oct 22, 2018, 2:58 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh that‚Äôs true
Oct 22, 2018, 2:58 PM
Varun Tekur
so if exams get curved to a B, then the median grade will prob be around like a B+/A- like you said
Oct 22, 2018, 2:57 PM
Varun Tekur
45
Oct 22, 2018, 2:57 PM
Varun Tekur
psets are 44
Oct 22, 2018, 2:57 PM
Varun Tekur
20
Oct 22, 2018, 2:57 PM
Sidharth Menon
as a %?
Oct 22, 2018, 2:56 PM
Sidharth Menon
how much are midterms worth
Oct 22, 2018, 2:56 PM
Varun Tekur
and those are basically As
Oct 22, 2018, 2:56 PM
Varun Tekur
oh dang, but psets are half of the grade
Oct 22, 2018, 2:56 PM
Sidharth Menon
grade inflation lol
Oct 22, 2018, 2:56 PM
Sidharth Menon
normally stuff is a B+/A- curve
Oct 22, 2018, 2:56 PM
Varun Tekur
really?
Oct 22, 2018, 2:56 PM
Sidharth Menon
wow that‚Äôs actually pretty rough
Oct 22, 2018, 2:56 PM
Varun Tekur
And they said the median on the midterm gets curved to a B, which is super generous imo
Oct 22, 2018, 2:55 PM
Varun Tekur
oh good
Oct 22, 2018, 2:55 PM
Sidharth Menon
I figured it out haha
Oct 22, 2018, 2:52 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah haha sorry I forgot to text u lol
Oct 22, 2018, 2:52 PM
Varun Tekur
pos is where you should move your postag to
Oct 22, 2018, 2:48 PM
Varun Tekur
you should be seeking to the aligned position, not pos
Oct 22, 2018, 2:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
where the out differs on byte 1, line 1
Oct 22, 2018, 12:50 AM
Sidharth Menon
I‚Äôm having this error on tears 20 and 21 for random seek order
Oct 22, 2018, 12:50 AM
Sidharth Menon
or the pos - pos%bufsize
Oct 22, 2018, 12:44 AM
Sidharth Menon
should you be lseeking to pos
Oct 22, 2018, 12:44 AM
Sidharth Menon
yo
Oct 22, 2018, 12:44 AM
Sidharth Menon
or something idk
üëçVarun Tekur
Oct 21, 2018, 11:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
more likely like an 87
Oct 21, 2018, 11:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
I mean yeah
Oct 21, 2018, 11:51 PM
Varun Tekur
thats pretty generous
Oct 21, 2018, 11:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
depends
Oct 21, 2018, 11:50 PM
Sidharth Menon
so I‚Äôd guess that a 108 raw score (mean) would be curved to like a...89? Maybe like a 91 or something
Oct 21, 2018, 11:50 PM
Varun Tekur
that makes me feel a lot better
Oct 21, 2018, 11:49 PM
Sidharth Menon
classes here normally get curved to a B+/A-
Oct 21, 2018, 11:49 PM
Varun Tekur
haha yeah
Oct 21, 2018, 11:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
but like if you studied you studied you know
Oct 21, 2018, 11:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
I didn‚Äôt do well either lol
Oct 21, 2018, 11:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
hahaha you‚Äôll be fine
Oct 21, 2018, 11:48 PM
Varun Tekur
I mean I didn't completely bomb it, I'm just not used to seeing such low raw scores lol
Oct 21, 2018, 11:40 PM
Varun Tekur
ok, I'm sure it'll be fine
Oct 21, 2018, 11:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
probably curved at the end but not sure
Oct 21, 2018, 11:38 PM
Varun Tekur
does the class get curved at the end, or does each test get curved?
Oct 21, 2018, 11:38 PM
Sidharth Menon
it be like that sometimes üò©
Oct 21, 2018, 11:37 PM
Sidharth Menon
me too lol and I studied for this
Oct 21, 2018, 11:37 PM
Sidharth Menon
Classes are normally curved to a B+, A-
Oct 21, 2018, 11:37 PM
Varun Tekur
I sure hope so lol
Oct 21, 2018, 11:37 PM
Sidharth Menon
They probably will haha
Oct 21, 2018, 11:37 PM
Sidharth Menon
lmao word
Oct 21, 2018, 11:37 PM
Varun Tekur
any chance these get scaled?
Oct 21, 2018, 11:36 PM
Varun Tekur
midterm grades also just came out
Oct 21, 2018, 11:35 PM
Sidharth Menon
I know lmao so clutch
Oct 21, 2018, 11:35 PM
Varun Tekur
Lol everyone gets a one day extension on the assignment
Oct 21, 2018, 11:23 PM
Sidharth Menon
are you here big guy?
Oct 21, 2018, 8:46 PM
Sidharth Menon
thanks dude üò©
Oct 21, 2018, 8:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
be there in a few
Oct 21, 2018, 8:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
I will roll there
Oct 21, 2018, 8:11 PM
Sidharth Menon
Ok word
Oct 21, 2018, 8:11 PM
Varun Tekur
I'm prob gonna go to cabot soon to work if you want to talk about CS
Oct 21, 2018, 8:05 PM
Varun Tekur
like test 1-3 say character i/o
Oct 21, 2018, 7:42 PM
Varun Tekur
You can check the files, but when doing make check, it also lists what type of test it is
Oct 21, 2018, 7:42 PM
Sidharth Menon
where do you find the code for these tests haha? cat61?
Oct 21, 2018, 6:52 PM
Sidharth Menon
ok word let me change these and lll check
Oct 21, 2018, 6:52 PM
Varun Tekur
like more than 1x
Oct 21, 2018, 6:51 PM
Varun Tekur
at least for the first 3 tests
Oct 21, 2018, 6:51 PM
Varun Tekur
It should be fast for those
Oct 21, 2018, 6:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
but should it still be slow?
Oct 21, 2018, 6:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
and then it should not ‚Äúfail‚Äù for readc and writec
Oct 21, 2018, 6:51 PM
Sidharth Menon
so we have to change that
Oct 21, 2018, 6:50 PM
Varun Tekur
yeah np
Oct 21, 2018, 6:50 PM
Varun Tekur
lol yeah you should be able to implement that quickly though
Oct 21, 2018, 6:50 PM
Sidharth Menon
thank you haha I was getting so confused why it was only doing 1 byte at a time
Oct 21, 2018, 6:50 PM
Sidharth Menon
ohhh man oh man
Oct 21, 2018, 6:50 PM
Sidharth Menon
that would make sense that those fail then haha
Oct 21, 2018, 6:50 PM
Varun Tekur
Yes
Oct 21, 2018, 6:49 PM
Sidharth Menon
so you need to change those too?
Oct 21, 2018, 6:49 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh ohhhhh
Oct 21, 2018, 6:49 PM
Varun Tekur
you basically just need to use the same code as read/write but for only one character
Oct 21, 2018, 6:49 PM
Sidharth Menon
that makes so much more sense lmao
Oct 21, 2018, 6:49 PM
Sidharth Menon
ohhh
Oct 21, 2018, 6:48 PM
Varun Tekur
so if you didnt change those, it would still be doing character at a time
Oct 21, 2018, 6:48 PM
Varun Tekur
ok, the first three tests use those
Oct 21, 2018, 6:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
I didn‚Äôt use readc and writec
Oct 21, 2018, 6:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
no
Oct 21, 2018, 6:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
I‚Äôm so confused haha
Oct 21, 2018, 6:48 PM
Varun Tekur
Did you change the readc and writec functions
Oct 21, 2018, 6:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
I copy and pasted lol?
Oct 21, 2018, 6:48 PM
Varun Tekur
And you implemented them the same exact way as the section video?
Oct 21, 2018, 6:48 PM
Sidharth Menon
basically (I had a case to return -1 if the system call in flush doesn‚Äôt work)
Oct 21, 2018, 6:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
and if read I just returned 0
Oct 21, 2018, 6:39 PM
Sidharth Menon
and for flush checked the mode and if it was write I did the stuff in the section notes
Oct 21, 2018, 6:39 PM
Sidharth Menon
but returned n (the result of the system call) for fill
Oct 21, 2018, 6:39 PM
Sidharth Menon
I hope so? I just did the same stuff as the section notes
Oct 21, 2018, 6:39 PM
Varun Tekur
did you implement fill and flush correctly?
Oct 21, 2018, 6:38 PM
Varun Tekur
I'll prob be free after like 8
Oct 21, 2018, 6:38 PM
Sidharth Menon
are you free anytime after 6:30?
Oct 21, 2018, 6:04 PM
Sidharth Menon
for some reason if I look at the strace from my implementation it‚Äôs calling system calls 1 byte at a time and I‚Äôm not sure why ://
Oct 21, 2018, 5:34 PM
Sidharth Menon
ah shit I still am having some trouble
Oct 21, 2018, 5:32 PM
Sidharth Menon
haha hoping chatting with you later will clear this up!!
Oct 21, 2018, 4:42 PM
Sidharth Menon
hmm right which makes sense
Oct 21, 2018, 4:42 PM
Varun Tekur
dang thats annoying
Oct 21, 2018, 4:42 PM
Varun Tekur
which is what I did
Oct 21, 2018, 4:41 PM
Varun Tekur
also, after translating the section notes, you can change read and write to use memcpy instead of character at a time to make it better
