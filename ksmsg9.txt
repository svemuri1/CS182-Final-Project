Aug 02, 2018 12:23pm

One of my professors was good friends with merrick garland at Harvard and he was telling me how Garland called him during the process and felt so betrayed
Aug 02, 2018 12:22pm
Ajay Singh
but i hate all this embedded institutionalism and crony capital bullshit
Aug 02, 2018 12:22pm
Ajay Singh
it's hard to distance myself since i did so much party shit in high school

Aug 02, 2018 12:21pm
Kevin Stephen

Aug 02, 2018 12:20pm
Kevin Stephen

Aug 02, 2018 12:20pm
Kevin Stephen
and i like merrick garland
Aug 02, 2018 12:20pm
Ajay Singh

Aug 02, 2018 12:20pm
Ajay Singh
like the merrick garland bullshit
Aug 02, 2018 12:20pm
Ajay Singh
i might be biased but i also think that democrats have more motivation than just party occupation
Aug 02, 2018 12:19pm
Kevin Stephen
although all i've seen from both sides of the aisle is obstruction
Aug 02, 2018 12:18pm
