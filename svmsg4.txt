np!!
Sep 21, 2017, 10:55 PM
Aaron Shi
thank you thank you
Sep 21, 2017, 10:52 PM
Aaron Shi
okay I think I get it
Sep 21, 2017, 10:52 PM
Aaron Shi
OH
Sep 21, 2017, 10:52 PM
Sreya Vemuri
so u have proved that they r equal therefore
Sep 21, 2017, 10:46 PM
Sreya Vemuri
and u can get both inequalities to equal this
Sep 21, 2017, 10:46 PM
Sreya Vemuri
so P(A \intersect B ) = P(A)P(B)
Sep 21, 2017, 10:46 PM
Sreya Vemuri
and P(B|A) = P(A intersect B)\P(A)
Sep 21, 2017, 10:45 PM
Sreya Vemuri
so u can say P(A|B) = P(A intersect B)\P(B)
Sep 21, 2017, 10:45 PM
Sreya Vemuri
u should just prove it algebraically
Sep 21, 2017, 10:45 PM
Sreya Vemuri
wait ur logic is what i said but my blockmate is a tf and he was like
Sep 21, 2017, 10:45 PM
Sreya Vemuri
well bc like
Sep 21, 2017, 10:45 PM
Aaron Shi
and it doesn't matter if you switch them?
Sep 21, 2017, 10:38 PM
Aaron Shi
A and B are arbirary
Sep 21, 2017, 10:38 PM
Aaron Shi
P(A|B) > P(A) is equivalent to P(B|A) > P(B) because
Sep 21, 2017, 10:38 PM
Aaron Shi
OK OK LAST THING
Sep 21, 2017, 10:38 PM
Aaron Shi
thank you
😍Sreya Vemuri
Sep 21, 2017, 10:37 PM
Aaron Shi
okay!
Sep 21, 2017, 10:37 PM
Aaron Shi
hmm
Sep 21, 2017, 10:36 PM
Sreya Vemuri
so you just have to find P(C) and P(G) using like counting
Sep 21, 2017, 10:35 PM
Sreya Vemuri
and then you know P(G|C) is 1
Sep 21, 2017, 10:35 PM
Sreya Vemuri
and G is the event that Monty shows you a goat
Sep 21, 2017, 10:35 PM
Sreya Vemuri
where C is the event that you initially pick a car
Sep 21, 2017, 10:35 PM
Sreya Vemuri
You sent a photo.

Sep 21, 2017, 10:35 PM
Sreya Vemuri
so
Sep 21, 2017, 10:34 PM
Sreya Vemuri
i did like bayes thm um
Sep 21, 2017, 10:34 PM
Aaron Shi
Part a...how did you set up your conditional probability?
Sep 21, 2017, 10:33 PM
Aaron Shi
oh and for 7
Sep 21, 2017, 10:32 PM
Aaron Shi
thanks!!
Sep 21, 2017, 10:32 PM
Aaron Shi
oh I see it
Sep 21, 2017, 10:32 PM
Sreya Vemuri
because you can use the def of conditional probability
Sep 21, 2017, 10:31 PM
Sreya Vemuri
and its easier to show it if you write it this way
Sep 21, 2017, 10:31 PM
Sreya Vemuri
so you can substitute
Sep 21, 2017, 10:30 PM
Sreya Vemuri
P(A|B) > P(A|B^c) = P(A|B > P(A)
Sep 21, 2017, 10:30 PM
Sreya Vemuri
because
Sep 21, 2017, 10:30 PM
Sreya Vemuri
this is equivalent to P(A|B) > P(A) = P(B|A) > P(B)
Sep 21, 2017, 10:30 PM
Sreya Vemuri
bc like u r trying to show that P(A|B) > P(A|B^c) = P(B|A) > P(B|A^c) but
Sep 21, 2017, 10:30 PM
Aaron Shi
how does that relate to P(B|A) > P(B|A^C)?
Sep 21, 2017, 10:30 PM
Aaron Shi
umm
Sep 21, 2017, 10:29 PM
Sreya Vemuri
does that make sense?
Sep 21, 2017, 10:29 PM
Sreya Vemuri
you just have to prove that P(A|B) > P(A) is equivalent to P(B|A) > P(B)
Sep 21, 2017, 10:28 PM
Sreya Vemuri
this
Sep 21, 2017, 10:28 PM
Sreya Vemuri
so now that youve shown thi
Sep 21, 2017, 10:28 PM
Sreya Vemuri
ok and then u do the same for the 2nd inequality
Sep 21, 2017, 10:28 PM
Aaron Shi
yes
Sep 21, 2017, 10:28 PM
Sreya Vemuri
did u show that P(A|B) > P(A|B^c) = P(A|B) > P(A)
Sep 21, 2017, 10:28 PM
Aaron Shi
but idk what to do after that
Sep 21, 2017, 10:27 PM
Aaron Shi
yah so I showed that P(A|B) > P(A)
Sep 21, 2017, 10:27 PM
Sreya Vemuri
do u get the part about like weighted averages
Sep 21, 2017, 10:27 PM
Sreya Vemuri
oh ok yeah
Sep 21, 2017, 10:27 PM
Aaron Shi
i read blitzstein's hint but it didn't really help
Sep 21, 2017, 10:27 PM
Sreya Vemuri
wait did u c the hint that joe sent out in the email
Sep 21, 2017, 10:27 PM
Aaron Shi
ok how do you do 5c?
