or make sure that f is well defined

I think you have to overwrite the placeholder
May 2, 2018, 3:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
no mine works fine
May 2, 2018, 3:29 PM
Krishna Suraj
we used a placeholder ref
May 2, 2018, 3:28 PM

yo did you get an out_of_memory error in letrec for eval_l if u did it
May 2, 2018, 3:28 PM
Sidharth Menon
from what I understand
Apr 13, 2018, 1:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
Anything is ok
Apr 13, 2018, 1:06 PM
Sidharth Menon
Honestly I think that’s fine
Apr 13, 2018, 1:06 PM
Krishna Suraj
pretty arbitrary
Apr 13, 2018, 1:04 PM
Krishna Suraj
mine is p random, the coordinates of the national parks in california in the order one should visit them
Apr 13, 2018, 1:04 PM
Krishna Suraj
i just copied most of testgraphs and am just implementing something
Apr 13, 2018, 1:04 PM
Krishna Suraj
oh i think i get it now
Apr 13, 2018, 1:04 PM
Sidharth Menon
The difficulty is you can do anything
Apr 13, 2018, 1:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
Oh for example?
Apr 13, 2018, 1:03 PM
Krishna Suraj
or do we make our own
Apr 13, 2018, 12:52 PM
Krishna Suraj
question: for the last part, do we just use the same graph data structure as in testgraphs.ml
Apr 13, 2018, 12:52 PM
Krishna Suraj
Hm ok i think that works thanks!

*from_list
Apr 13, 2018, 11:51 AM
Sidharth Menon
and call Array.to_list
Apr 13, 2018, 11:51 AM
Sidharth Menon
but you’re only trying to draw one, but it still works. You can put the tuple in a list
Apr 13, 2018, 11:51 AM
Sidharth Menon
So what you can do is put them in a list
Apr 13, 2018, 11:50 AM
Sidharth Menon
It draws all of the lines in the array
Apr 13, 2018, 11:50 AM
Sidharth Menon
Tuples
Apr 13, 2018, 11:50 AM
Sidharth Menon
I think part of the problem is that the graphics draw segment thing, if I remember correctly, takes int * int * int * int tooled in an array
Apr 13, 2018, 11:50 AM
Krishna Suraj
for edge, i used a function in the graphics module called draw_segments which takes in a tuple of int * int * int * int (coordinates of the source and target). So did a match to get those coordinates and put those variables into draw_segment - is there a way to make sure ocaml recognizes that those values have to be int? I'm getting a type error because it thinks those variables are 'a * 'b * 'c * 'd
Apr 13, 2018, 11:48 AM
Krishna Suraj
also another quick question
Apr 13, 2018, 11:46 AM
Krishna Suraj
Makes sense thanks
Apr 13, 2018, 11:46 AM
Sidharth Menon
Including the border
Apr 13, 2018, 11:46 AM
Krishna Suraj
Ah ok
Apr 13, 2018, 11:46 AM
Sidharth Menon
So you need to calculate the height and width
Apr 13, 2018, 11:46 AM
Sidharth Menon
Also remember that the draw method takes in x0 y0 w h
Apr 13, 2018, 11:46 AM
Sidharth Menon
Then draw a rectangle (but don’t call fill for this specific one) on that area (after adding borders to each thing)
Apr 13, 2018, 11:45 AM
Sidharth Menon
yeah so what I did is you search for the list of points for the most extreme x values (min and max) and y values (min and max)
Apr 13, 2018, 11:45 AM
Krishna Suraj
Hey how did you go about implementing draw zone? is there a method in graphics that does that for you or do you have to manually search through the list of points to find the extremes?
