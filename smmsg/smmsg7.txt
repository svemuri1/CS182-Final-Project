Mar 1, 2018, 4:15 PM
Rajath Salegame
upstairs
Mar 1, 2018, 4:15 PM
Rajath Salegame
science center bro
Mar 1, 2018, 4:15 PM
Sidharth Menon
wya
Mar 1, 2018, 4:15 PM
Sidharth Menon
With some kind of coefficients in front but idk
Mar 1, 2018, 4:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
I think it was like sqrt (x^2 + x^4)
Mar 1, 2018, 4:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
Just got out of class so omw to Thayer
Mar 1, 2018, 4:06 PM
Rajath Salegame
For your determinant for 2
Mar 1, 2018, 3:26 PM
Rajath Salegame
What did you get
Mar 1, 2018, 3:26 PM
Rajath Salegame
lol
Feb 22, 2018, 1:35 AM
Sidharth Menon
Bro idk how it works I just copied down what meng said
Feb 22, 2018, 1:35 AM
Rajath Salegame
idk this is weird
Feb 22, 2018, 1:34 AM
Rajath Salegame
oh
Feb 22, 2018, 1:34 AM
Sidharth Menon
Because you‚Äôre slicing along a latitude
Feb 22, 2018, 1:34 AM
Sidharth Menon
it‚Äôs the top of the curved surface
Feb 22, 2018, 1:34 AM
Rajath Salegame
where does this flat one come from
Feb 22, 2018, 1:34 AM
Rajath Salegame
what the fuck
Feb 22, 2018, 1:33 AM
Sidharth Menon
I think one is for the curved part and one is for the flat one
Feb 22, 2018, 1:33 AM
Sidharth Menon
Dude honestly I‚Äôm not sure
Feb 22, 2018, 1:33 AM
Rajath Salegame
corresponding to what?
Feb 22, 2018, 1:33 AM
Sidharth Menon
You separate the area into two integrals
Feb 22, 2018, 1:31 AM
Rajath Salegame
like what is that equation
Feb 22, 2018, 1:30 AM
Rajath Salegame
what's that other shit
Feb 22, 2018, 1:30 AM
Rajath Salegame
for 5b
Feb 22, 2018, 1:30 AM
Rajath Salegame
wait also lol
Feb 22, 2018, 1:30 AM
Sidharth Menon
Hahahaha I know
Feb 22, 2018, 1:26 AM
Rajath Salegame
just slice it into quarters üòÇ
Feb 22, 2018, 1:26 AM
Rajath Salegame
these people are fucking stupid
Feb 22, 2018, 1:26 AM
Rajath Salegame
although if you think about it
Feb 22, 2018, 1:26 AM
Sidharth Menon
that‚Äôs what meng said
Feb 22, 2018, 1:26 AM
Sidharth Menon
Yes
Feb 22, 2018, 1:26 AM
Sidharth Menon
sure I hope that helped haha
Feb 22, 2018, 1:26 AM
Rajath Salegame
lol im just gonna assume that a value is approx right
Feb 22, 2018, 1:26 AM
Rajath Salegame
ok i got it now thanks
Feb 22, 2018, 1:25 AM
Sidharth Menon
because you need the slice to be a 1/3 or something idk
Feb 22, 2018, 1:24 AM
Sidharth Menon
I mean 1/3
Feb 22, 2018, 1:23 AM
Sidharth Menon
Or 1/3
Feb 22, 2018, 1:23 AM
Sidharth Menon
yeah and I think to do that you need the values where the sin - sin^3 factor is equal to 1 or something
Feb 22, 2018, 1:23 AM
Rajath Salegame
but how do you solve for that using the expression you got for volume between equator and latitude L
Feb 22, 2018, 1:23 AM
Rajath Salegame
no like it says what values of L solve the original problem
Feb 22, 2018, 1:23 AM
Sidharth Menon
At the end of 5a
Feb 22, 2018, 1:22 AM
Sidharth Menon
I think so?
Feb 22, 2018, 1:22 AM
Rajath Salegame
wait what does that tell you though lol
Feb 22, 2018, 1:22 AM
Sidharth Menon
So find the zeros of that equation
Feb 22, 2018, 1:21 AM
Sidharth Menon
We‚Äôre supposed to solve for theta or something
Feb 22, 2018, 1:21 AM
Sidharth Menon
Oh
Feb 22, 2018, 1:21 AM
Rajath Salegame
5a
Feb 22, 2018, 1:17 AM
Sidharth Menon
5a or 5b
Feb 22, 2018, 1:17 AM
Rajath Salegame
like i didn't get the steps you did after that
Feb 22, 2018, 1:17 AM
Rajath Salegame
what did you do after you got the volume between equator and latitude L
Feb 22, 2018, 1:17 AM
Sidharth Menon
yeah
Feb 22, 2018, 1:17 AM
Rajath Salegame
So like for 5
Feb 22, 2018, 1:16 AM
Rajath Salegame
Yo
Feb 22, 2018, 1:16 AM
Sidharth Menon

By TF
Feb 13, 2018, 10:44 PM
Sidharth Menon
Not consensus
Feb 13, 2018, 10:44 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah apparently
Feb 13, 2018, 10:44 PM
Rajath Salegame
is 1.something the right answer by consensus
Feb 13, 2018, 10:43 PM
Rajath Salegame
Bro we always get shafted on these
Feb 13, 2018, 10:43 PM
Rajath Salegame
fuuuuuuuck
Feb 13, 2018, 10:42 PM
Sidharth Menon

Feb 13, 2018, 10:42 PM
Rajath Salegame

Feb 13, 2018, 10:40 PM
Rajath Salegame
Wait fuck for real
Feb 13, 2018, 10:40 PM
Sidharth Menon

Feb 13, 2018, 10:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
0.999
Feb 13, 2018, 10:39 PM
Rajath Salegame
Like the value for Simpson
Feb 13, 2018, 10:36 PM
Rajath Salegame
What did you get for 2 btw
Feb 13, 2018, 10:36 PM
Rajath Salegame
Yeah I mean it makes sense
Feb 13, 2018, 10:35 PM
Rajath Salegame
Oh sick
Feb 13, 2018, 10:34 PM
Sidharth Menon
Jason said it looked fine
Feb 13, 2018, 10:34 PM
Sidharth Menon
I hope it‚Äôs right haha
Feb 13, 2018, 10:34 PM
Sidharth Menon
That‚Äôs pretty much exactly what I did
Feb 13, 2018, 10:34 PM
Rajath Salegame
Is this kinda what we were supposed to do
Feb 13, 2018, 10:34 PM
Rajath Salegame
Rajath sent a photo.

Feb 13, 2018, 10:34 PM
Sidharth Menon
I made A as [a1 | a2] where a1 and a2 are 2d vectors
Feb 13, 2018, 10:34 PM
Sidharth Menon
yeah
Feb 13, 2018, 10:33 PM
Rajath Salegame
Did you just like set the first column to some arbitrary vector
Feb 13, 2018, 10:15 PM
Rajath Salegame
I think that‚Äôs what I did lmao
Feb 13, 2018, 10:15 PM
Rajath Salegame
Oh ok
Feb 13, 2018, 10:14 PM
Sidharth Menon
And say without loss of generality we‚Äôve chosen the 1st, but can swap any other column
Feb 13, 2018, 10:13 PM
Sidharth Menon
So just brute force it for he first column
Feb 13, 2018, 10:13 PM
Rajath Salegame
Dk if it‚Äôs right
Feb 13, 2018, 10:07 PM
Rajath Salegame
Yeah like I did some bs with vectors but
Feb 13, 2018, 10:07 PM
Rajath Salegame
Ok
Feb 13, 2018, 10:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
I‚Äôll let you know
Feb 13, 2018, 10:07 PM
Sidharth Menon
