Dec 9, 2018, 3:41 PM
Sidharth Menon

Dec 9, 2018, 3:41 PM
Mridu Nanda
thats what i did
Dec 9, 2018, 3:41 PM
Mridu Nanda
but yes
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Mridu Nanda
idk if there is a realloc call or soemtibgn
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
and everything was fine?
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
So you just realloced
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
hmm
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Mridu Nanda
might be in a diffrent part of ur code
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
seems to be the case but I can‚Äôt figure out where?
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Mridu Nanda
no
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
Do you have to lock when you realloc?
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
getting data race?
Dec 9, 2018, 3:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
ok thanks!!
Dec 9, 2018, 3:08 PM
Mridu Nanda
i used an arry
Dec 9, 2018, 3:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
did you use a std::vector or an array
Dec 9, 2018, 3:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
I see so just realloc
Dec 9, 2018, 3:03 PM
Sidharth Menon
ohh
Dec 9, 2018, 3:02 PM
Mridu Nanda
and double the size of the buffer every time it gets full
Dec 9, 2018, 2:53 PM
Mridu Nanda
c
Dec 9, 2018, 2:53 PM
Mridu Nanda
so make the array in the struct dynami
Dec 9, 2018, 2:53 PM
Mridu Nanda
u need to solve a buffer overflow
Dec 9, 2018, 2:53 PM
Mridu Nanda
nice
Dec 9, 2018, 2:53 PM
Sidharth Menon
how did you do 5? since there‚Äôs too much stuff for the size of the buffer??
Dec 9, 2018, 2:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
ok I think we got it
Dec 9, 2018, 2:29 PM
Sidharth Menon
oh I see
Dec 9, 2018, 2:29 PM
Mridu Nanda
The same lock I used to get rid of move_done
Dec 9, 2018, 12:24 AM
Mridu Nanda
Well I slept with a lock
Dec 9, 2018, 12:24 AM
Mridu Nanda
I just checked if the result was greater than 0
Dec 9, 2018, 12:24 AM
Sidharth Menon
(If you have a plus in the buffer)?
Dec 8, 2018, 7:40 PM
Sidharth Menon
how do you do phase 4? do you just sleep the amount it tells you to before checking if the connection is good?
Dec 8, 2018, 7:39 PM
Sidharth Menon
getting this thing 9.359 sec: server returned error: -1 request sent to STOPped server (0.218 sec into STOP period, 1.559 sec remaining)
Dec 8, 2018, 7:39 PM
Sidharth Menon

Nov 21, 2018, 7:12 PM
Sidharth Menon
(Actually lol you‚Äôre a lot smarter than me so you‚Äôre definitely already done haha)
üëéMridu Nanda
Nov 21, 2018, 7:11 PM
Sidharth Menon
(Assuming you‚Äôre done with the pset)
Nov 21, 2018, 7:11 PM
Sidharth Menon
and run ‚Äúecho hi | less‚Äù
Nov 21, 2018, 7:11 PM
Sidharth Menon

Nov 21, 2018, 7:10 PM
Mridu Nanda

Nov 21, 2018, 7:04 PM
Sidharth Menon
hey quick question
Nov 21, 2018, 6:20 PM
Sidharth Menon
nvm that was a dumb question I figured it out haha
üëçMridu Nanda
Nov 20, 2018, 1:05 PM
Sidharth Menon
do you know how to access the file descriptors for another command
Nov 20, 2018, 12:22 AM
Sidharth Menon
hey
Nov 20, 2018, 12:22 AM
Mridu Nanda
yup
Nov 19, 2018, 7:09 PM
Sidharth Menon
do you exit after?
Nov 19, 2018, 5:50 PM
Sidharth Menon
like after you fork and stuff and run it in the background for step 2
Nov 19, 2018, 5:50 PM
Sidharth Menon
did you exit the child process for backgrounded stuff
Nov 19, 2018, 5:50 PM
Sidharth Menon
sorry quick question
Nov 19, 2018, 5:49 PM
Sidharth Menon
I just started with Milan
Nov 18, 2018, 9:18 PM
Sidharth Menon
Hahah I‚Äôm sorry I suck with FB messenger
Nov 18, 2018, 9:18 PM
Mridu Nanda
Hey have u started this pset?
Nov 15, 2018, 9:41 AM
Mridu Nanda
(i also reset my counter to 0 but I dont think you will do that in your version)
Nov 5, 2018, 12:19 AM
Mridu Nanda
but if the counter = 1, then set the owner to 0
Nov 5, 2018, 12:19 AM
Mridu Nanda
so if the counter is > 1, just decrement and exit
Nov 5, 2018, 12:19 AM
Mridu Nanda
but in ur case, as long as ur calling it in the correct place, i think that should be fine.
üò†Sidharth Menon
Nov 5, 2018, 12:19 AM
Mridu Nanda
and only called kfree if it was ready to actually be freed
üòÆSidharth Menon
Nov 5, 2018, 12:18 AM
Mridu Nanda
i actually decremented my stuff outside kfree
Nov 5, 2018, 12:18 AM
Mridu Nanda
np, and yea i was talking to milan about this
Nov 5, 2018, 12:18 AM
Sidharth Menon
And then set the owner to 0
Nov 5, 2018, 12:17 AM
Sidharth Menon
(& decrement counter)
Nov 5, 2018, 12:17 AM
Sidharth Menon
did you just check if counter > 1
Nov 5, 2018, 12:17 AM
Sidharth Menon
for kfree
Nov 5, 2018, 12:16 AM
Sidharth Menon
Sorry to bother ya
Nov 5, 2018, 12:16 AM
Sidharth Menon
haha one more question
Nov 5, 2018, 12:16 AM
Mridu Nanda
Idk if that will fix all ur problems
Nov 4, 2018, 11:30 PM
Mridu Nanda
Haha np it took me a while
Nov 4, 2018, 11:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
that‚Äôs so smart haha
Nov 4, 2018, 11:30 PM
Sidharth Menon

Nov 4, 2018, 11:30 PM
Sidharth Menon
You: Û∞ÄÄ

Nov 4, 2018, 11:29 PM
Mridu Nanda
But reset that to 0 at the start of every call to kalloc
Nov 4, 2018, 11:28 PM
Mridu Nanda
There is something like next_alloc something idk
Nov 4, 2018, 11:28 PM
Mridu Nanda
And not going backwards to check if there is free mem
Nov 4, 2018, 11:28 PM
Mridu Nanda
So rn kalloc is going in order
Nov 4, 2018, 11:28 PM
Mridu Nanda
Yes! I forgot to do this too
Nov 4, 2018, 11:28 PM
Sidharth Menon
should we have done other stuff
Nov 4, 2018, 11:27 PM
Sidharth Menon
ok all we did with kalloc was increment the ‚Äúcounter‚Äù (addition to the pageinfo struct)
Nov 4, 2018, 11:27 PM
Sidharth Menon
oof
Nov 4, 2018, 11:27 PM
Mridu Nanda
Also make sure u fix kalloc
Nov 4, 2018, 11:26 PM
Mridu Nanda
A lot of my bugs were related to not cleaning up ALL the memory
Nov 4, 2018, 11:26 PM
Mridu Nanda
I hit this problem many times
Nov 4, 2018, 11:25 PM
Mridu Nanda
Ah yes
Nov 4, 2018, 11:25 PM
