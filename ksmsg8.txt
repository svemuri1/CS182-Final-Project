Oct 21, 2018 8:27pm
Kevin Stephen
i know what to do but i don't have that much intuition for it
Oct 21, 2018 8:26pm
Kevin Stephen
if we could talk through graphical sensitivity for like 10m later that'd be great
Oct 21, 2018 8:26pm
Kevin Stephen
also
Oct 21, 2018 8:26pm
Kevin Stephen
so having the z there allowed me to keep track
Oct 21, 2018 8:25pm
Kevin Stephen
i just do it bc one time i had to normalize the z column because i ended up multiplying it by a constant
Oct 21, 2018 8:25pm
Kevin Stephen
i don't think you need to
Oct 21, 2018 8:25pm
Kevin Stephen
i always do but that's just as a habit
Oct 21, 2018 8:25pm
Adil Bhatia
like the one that is always 1 0 0 0 ...
Oct 21, 2018 7:57pm
Adil Bhatia
wait for the tableaus we dont need to include the z column do we
Oct 21, 2018 7:57pm
Adil Bhatia
yup nw
Oct 21, 2018 7:26pm
Kevin Stephen
ty
Oct 21, 2018 7:26pm
Kevin Stephen
oh right right it's the dual optimal solution
Oct 21, 2018 7:26pm
Adil Bhatia
so y^T = (140 30 0 0 -120)
Oct 21, 2018 7:22pm
Adil Bhatia
Adil sent a photo.

Oct 21, 2018 7:21pm
Adil Bhatia
it's given in the sensitivity analysis
Oct 21, 2018 7:21pm
Adil Bhatia
lemme check
Oct 21, 2018 7:20pm
Kevin Stephen
simplex?
Oct 21, 2018 7:18pm
Kevin Stephen
how'd you compute y^T? since they don't give us the final tableau
Oct 21, 2018 7:17pm
Kevin Stephen
for 9e on the review
Oct 21, 2018 7:17pm
Adil Bhatia
Cuz its really expensive

Kevin Stephen
these days
May 27, 2018 11:04am
Kevin Stephen
but i think i'm getting more interested in tech and entrepreneurship and so am more drawn to VC
May 27, 2018 11:04am
Kevin Stephen
i think a month ago i would've said yes
May 27, 2018 11:03am
Adil Bhatia
Would you take top PE over VC
May 27, 2018 11:00am
Adil Bhatia
I‚Äôm just asking in general
May 27, 2018 11:00am
Adil Bhatia
No I know
May 27, 2018 11:00am
Kevin Stephen
Insight is VC
May 27, 2018 10:59am

May 26, 2018 8:18pm
Kevin Stephen
But out of these two I like the canvas better
May 26, 2018 8:18pm
Kevin Stephen
Or the boat shoes w shorts too
May 26, 2018 8:17pm
Kevin Stephen
Because you can wear both with almost any kind of pants
May 26, 2018 8:17pm
Kevin Stephen
I would go for either a basic brown boat shoe or chukka boot
May 26, 2018 8:17pm
Kevin Stephen
Just not my style
May 26, 2018 8:17pm
Kevin Stephen
But I do like the brown
May 26, 2018 8:17pm

Adil Bhatia
Okay wait sorry I gtg
May 25, 2018 10:30am
Adil Bhatia
So will definitely need a strong understanding of the market your company is in specifically
May 25, 2018 10:30am
Kevin Stephen
Right
May 25, 2018 10:30am
Adil Bhatia
I think VC is def more the latter
May 25, 2018 10:30am
Adil Bhatia
So that‚Äôs why I focused on saying why this company is good to go and why there‚Äôs space to grow
May 25, 2018 10:30am
Adil Bhatia
Bc Growth equity looks at stable business modes
May 25, 2018 10:29am
Kevin Stephen
I‚Äôve studied banking interview questions the last couple days but will switch gears bc I just got the insight email
üëçAdil Bhatia
May 25, 2018 10:29am
Adil Bhatia
And think of why financially speaking but I think for VC it‚Äôs more important to see if there‚Äôs room for growth
May 25, 2018 10:29am
Adil Bhatia
Right exactly
May 25, 2018 10:29am
Kevin Stephen
No that‚Äôs really helpful
May 25, 2018 10:29am
Adil Bhatia
But that‚Äôs sort of an overview
May 25, 2018 10:29am
Kevin Stephen
I should practice figuring out what I like about companies and what I don‚Äôt
May 25, 2018 10:29am
Adil Bhatia
I know that‚Äôs a bit vague
May 25, 2018 10:29am
Kevin Stephen
Oooo okay
May 25, 2018 10:28am
Adil Bhatia
Bringing Netflix before the investment committee
Tell me 5 things you like about the company and 3 things you don‚Äôt

Okay now you‚Äôre on a call with the CEO what 3 questions would you ask

Some sort of follow up on those questions involving how you would use a financial metric to calculate/come to a conclusion
May 25, 2018 10:28am
Adil Bhatia
Like for instance GA gave me the following
May 25, 2018 10:27am
Adil Bhatia
Oh wait and be ready potentially for a case study
üòÆKevin Stephen
May 25, 2018 10:27am
Kevin Stephen
Got it got it
May 25, 2018 10:27am
Adil Bhatia
VCs really just want super smart people who love learning
May 25, 2018 10:26am
Adil Bhatia
At the end of the day you just have to be passionate about learning and talk intelligently about those companies you bring into the interview
May 25, 2018 10:26am
Adil Bhatia
It‚Äôll all come together when you find companies to talk about
May 25, 2018 10:26am
Adil Bhatia
Perpetual license vs subscription services
May 25, 2018 10:26am
Kevin Stephen
Gotcha
May 25, 2018 10:25am
Kevin Stephen
Ok that‚Äôs super helpful
May 25, 2018 10:25am
Adil Bhatia
Then dive deep into those business modes
May 25, 2018 10:25am
Kevin Stephen
But also mostly growth yeah
May 25, 2018 10:25am
Adil Bhatia
Okay
May 25, 2018 10:25am
Kevin Stephen
Mostly software stuff
May 25, 2018 10:25am
Adil Bhatia
Do they focus on tech companies or just general high growth?
May 25, 2018 10:25am
Adil Bhatia
And then find some others you think are interesting
May 25, 2018 10:25am
Adil Bhatia
Just in case
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Adil Bhatia
And be prepared to talk about 1 they have that you don‚Äôt like
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Adil Bhatia
Look at 1-2 companies insight has that you like
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Adil Bhatia
Both yea
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Adil Bhatia
If you were on the phone with the ceo what‚Äôs the first 3 questions you‚Äôd ask
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Kevin Stephen
Like Insight‚Äôs portfolio companies and then companies I would source?
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Adil Bhatia
And then they will prob ask questions like
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Adil Bhatia
And be able to talk about business models at length
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Kevin Stephen
Gotcha
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Adil Bhatia
Have companies in mind
May 25, 2018 10:24am
Adil Bhatia

May 25, 2018 10:23am
Kevin Stephen
Trying to figure out what a VC superday would look like
May 25, 2018 10:23am
Kevin Stephen

May 25, 2018 10:23am
Adil Bhatia
