Josh Seides
Josh is a unique individual and applicant, as he has an equally strong passion for software engineering and entrepreneurship. He enjoys creative problem solving, the flexibility to learn as much as he can, and collaboration with others. He regularly participates in hackathons, learns new languages/frameworks in his free time, and codes out MVPs for startup ideas. More importantly, he cares about his work‚Äôs social impact. He started a nonprofit to help senior citizens learn technology and another program to teach coding to elementary school students.

Furthermore, Josh holds extensive knowledge in many aspects of software engineering, including full-stack web development, mobile development, API creation, and data pipelines. He managed the engineering division for DEV, a branch of the largest student-run company in the world (at Harvard), built an entire in-production React app for CBS Sports, and has served as a Teaching Fellow for 2 Harvard computer science courses.
