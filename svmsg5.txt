Oct 5, 2018, 11:47 AM
Eric Timmerman
But do inquire about the above
Oct 5, 2018, 2:08 AM
Eric Timmerman
Ok I still think you shouldn‚Äôt sell yourself short
Oct 5, 2018, 2:08 AM
Sreya Vemuri
esp bc I wanna live in New York after graduation
Oct 5, 2018, 1:18 AM
Sreya Vemuri
also ya would probs not go full time at apple
Oct 5, 2018, 1:18 AM
Sreya Vemuri
ooooh I have no idea
Oct 5, 2018, 1:17 AM
Eric Timmerman
Also would you be able to secure the full time google offer and then intern somewhere else the year after?
Oct 5, 2018, 1:14 AM
Eric Timmerman
So would you defs not want to go full time at apple?
Oct 5, 2018, 1:14 AM
Sreya Vemuri
I also just feel like intern interviews are so much easier than full time lmao
Oct 4, 2018, 8:10 PM
Sreya Vemuri
not like groundbreaking
Oct 4, 2018, 8:09 PM
Sreya Vemuri
and I think the startups r cool but
Oct 4, 2018, 8:09 PM
Sreya Vemuri
Nah it‚Äôs for mtv but if u intern there 2 summers in a row there‚Äôs no interviews for full time LOL
Oct 4, 2018, 8:09 PM
Eric Timmerman
Is the google return NY again? Cupertino is a bit boring yeah but that might be worth if the team is cool which it sounds like
Oct 4, 2018, 7:57 PM
Eric Timmerman
Also google interviews you at the end of internships for return offers no?
Oct 4, 2018, 7:56 PM
Eric Timmerman
Also you ostensibly passed 3 company‚Äôs interviews so idk what makes you think you can‚Äôt pass google in the future
Oct 4, 2018, 7:56 PM
Eric Timmerman
Having big names will make it easier to get startup offers for next summer too
Oct 4, 2018, 7:55 PM
Eric Timmerman
But if that‚Äôs not compelling don‚Äôt just do it because it‚Äôs a startup
Oct 4, 2018, 7:55 PM
Eric Timmerman
So is SF is something you‚Äôre really interested in sure, or if you think liver amp and foursquare do cool shit
Oct 4, 2018, 7:54 PM
Eric Timmerman
Like you really like the work they do or the place they‚Äôre in
Oct 4, 2018, 7:54 PM
Eric Timmerman
Startups are nothing to write home about unless there‚Äôs a compelling reason to go there
Oct 4, 2018, 7:54 PM
Sreya Vemuri
sorry that was long idk if this makes sense haha
Oct 4, 2018, 7:52 PM
Sreya Vemuri
or like full time opportunities
Oct 4, 2018, 7:52 PM
Sreya Vemuri
like being in SF or the project I am working on
Oct 4, 2018, 7:51 PM
Sreya Vemuri
but I can‚Äôt decide what is more important to me
Oct 4, 2018, 7:51 PM
Sreya Vemuri
bc those are both in SF
Oct 4, 2018, 7:51 PM
Sreya Vemuri
and then I just like can‚Äôt decide if I wanna go to a startup
Oct 4, 2018, 7:51 PM
Sreya Vemuri
which is boring
Oct 4, 2018, 7:51 PM
Sreya Vemuri
except it is in Cupertino
Oct 4, 2018, 7:51 PM
Sreya Vemuri
but then like Apple I normally would not consider but my offer is for the ML health time which I think is so lit
Oct 4, 2018, 7:50 PM
Sreya Vemuri
and I will not be able to pass full time interviews there so if I go back it will be easier !!
Oct 4, 2018, 7:50 PM
Sreya Vemuri
but at the same time I might want to go full time at google
Oct 4, 2018, 7:50 PM
Sreya Vemuri
like I should try something different
Oct 4, 2018, 7:49 PM
Sreya Vemuri
and I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt go back to google
Oct 4, 2018, 7:49 PM
Sreya Vemuri
Ok so my options are google apple liveramp or foursquare
Oct 4, 2018, 7:49 PM
Eric Timmerman
Hit me
Oct 4, 2018, 7:41 PM
