Zinn was a socialist targeted by the US gov't lolol
Jan 18, 2015 12:03am
Kevin Stephen
"Later in the 1960s, as a result of Zinn's campaigning against the Vietnam War and his influence on Martin Luther King, Jr., the FBI designated Zinn a high security risk to the country, a category that allowed them to summarily arrest him if a state of emergency were to be declared.[67][69] The FBI memos also show that they were concerned with Zinn‚Äôs repeated criticism of the FBI for failing to protect blacks against white mob violence. Zinn's daughter said she was not surprised by the files; "He always knew they had a file on him".[67]"

Feb 20, 2014 4:05pm

Feb 20, 2014 3:43pm
Kevin Stephen
Every ton over 100 tpy
Feb 20, 2014 3:42pm
Kevin Stephen
It's like this:
Feb 20, 2014 3:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Actually no wait
Feb 20, 2014 3:42pm
Kevin Stephen
And they pay for every ton of carbon emitted no matter what
Feb 20, 2014 3:42pm
Kevin Stephen
Yep sure
Feb 20, 2014 3:42pm
Adekunle Balogun
well the idea i am getting is that you want corporations to pay for every ton of emissions that they release over a certain threshold. I just skimmed but it seems well written. Im going to be very busy from now until about 7:30 so can i given more comments later today?

Obama shouldn't be taking such a significant step with regards to the nations economy without the approval of Congress. For Pete's sake, this is a republic. This would constitute a flagrant abuse of the executive power of the president, even disregarding the burden it would cause the American taxpayer.
Feb 04, 2014 4:48pm
Adekunle Balogun
Obama plans on using an executive order to raise minimum wage for a certain group of workers. The EOrder allows him to pass it without necessarily having the approval of congress Your take? (Just for a poll im doing)
Feb 04, 2014 12:59pm
Kevin Stephen
Haha well it might improve the quality of life for federal workers but it should at least be a Congressional decision

I didn't want to post this on Facebook, but regarding the respect life post u made, I think is sad that these politician expect a child, let alone one with a disability, to make a choice like that. I just had to get that out.

If you have notebooks with concepts from algebra I or geometry, refer to them constantly. It helped me a lot. And do the challenge questions in the book.

Ok because the course requires a 90 to pass and I'm just skating by on a 92... So... And he said it gets harder... So...
