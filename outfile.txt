I thought you guys were leaving tomorrow for some reason lol
Oh shit you’re righhhht I totally forgot about that
He worked through our timetable lol
11:15 works just asked my dad
We’re all meeting tomorrow at 11 right
Bet
let’s just pick one and roll with it
Verde doesn’t sound bad either
Daily Creative Food Co?
looks alright?
That sounds fine
but maybe less than 20 minute drive ?
4 pm
Sorry
Our flight isn’t till 2 pm
I think we can do more than that
hmm
B Bistro?
good point
Blue Collar? Not sure if it’s too far
Slide into those dms 😉
and then usleep that amount
just read from the buffer the number of seconds if there's a plus in front
this doesn't work
originally
getting this thing 9.359 sec: server returned error: -1 request sent to STOPped server (0.218 sec into STOP period, 1.559 sec remaining)
after a while
i changed it and now it’ll have this like catastrophic error lolll
I think it’s wrong tho
it keeps saying that “expected move at (__, __), you skipped to (__, __)”
have a little trouble with step 4
yo
thanks buddy
that makes sense
Oh ok
what the hell lol
Oh
pset
do you know what we have to do for this part
hey I’m a little confused on phase 2
Thanks buddy!! Appreciate it
I don’t want to cause u any problems lolll
that’s fair lol
right
or just generally
Does yours fail INTR3 with LSAN stuff
we might be doing a pretty similar thing
And return the child’s pid
I set the pgids, then close relevant pipe fds, and then set pid to the child’s pid
In the parent
then I exec
then I perform redirects (since these have higher precedence I think)
then I do my forking stuff
In child: I set pid to the child’s pid. Then i do the same setpgid stuff as u
Then I fork
Then I set up the file descriptors for forking (but I think that’s just implementation specific)
so basically first I do the same c str stuff as u
I do it a little differently
in make_child, right?
& the rest of child
what does your run look like?
weird
and that was the only time it failed
But I’ve run it like 8? Times now
my INTR 5 failed once with leaks
right exactly
The highlighted stuff is the parent’s stuff
You sent a photo.
the point of the race condition is to ensure that the child (the executing process) is part of the group
Since it’s the child’s pgid
You should be using forkPid for the parent
Oh
I can run it again if you want tho
I was talking about the leak haha
yeah I did
I haven’t had an issue with anything failing since we made the fix
No I don’t think so?
but it’s not really graded anyways
To figure it out
You can call me if you want
Weird
easier to talk through it I think haha
give me a call if you’re free
Varun missed a call from you.
ours was as well
your run is probably slightly wrong
we fixed it
Oh interesting
the TFs say it’s ok
Looks like the bugs are probably fine
and variables
like the command “history”
yeah we just chose easy stuff lol
Varun missed a call from you.
that’s wicked smaht
Yeah I think that’s a good call
like wtf does that mean hhahaha
the error message is just like “its too slow”
and it passed each time
and I ran it again like 5 times
I have 0 idea how to fix it lol
I mean I guess?
freaking L
but nah no one has responded
I just woke up lol
I guess it wasn’t a quick nap
also imma take a quick nap rn haha I took at flight home at like 6:30 am
so weird
weird
never fails on your VM though?
that’s interesting
oh what lol
What happens for your pipe 5
I bumped that question
and that they “think they fixed it”
And a TF said that the grading server has issues
If you scroll down someone said the same thing on Monday
it looks like that -might- be a problem with the grading server
but i haven't had problems with pipe 5
super weird, INTR5 fails in grading server only with memory sanitization & leak detection with no error code other than "should've passed in 0.150 seconds"
and ok will look at that...will probably do that after I finish cd
I ended up figuring out something for step 8 similar to that
ok let me check
just like if the global is SIGINT then just reset the global signal thing and continue?
and like next to the shit from the zombie process
and set that to the signal from the signal handler
Do you have a global signal_status
What do you do to make a command line print somethin new
For part 8
also
right I get that part I think because you don’t want parent to do some shit that child doesn’t receive
thanks dude
that’s so smart
Holy snap I see
(If pgid is 0 to begin with)
or does that automatically happen if you call setpgid(x, 0)
what about the bs in the hint to do if pgid == 0?
Wait maybe that’s wrong loll that’s 4 calls?
U set child’s pid to pgid if pgid != 0, otherwise you give it a new pgid (by calling setpgid(0,0))
in both parent and child
so just checking
ohh I think I get it now haha
ok sorry lol I’m super tired that was such a dumb question
LOL
I be dumb to
nvm
*pid of fork
isn’t that like a kernel thing??
when would the pgid of fork return 0
wait what
the same update in both?
I seeee
oohhh
when the pid is 0 or the pgid is 0?
but no idea what it actually means lolll
Kind of slept through the race conditions part so I vaguely understand it
in make_child
what does it mean we need to call setpgid at two different points
For sure
I definitely couldn’t handle another month of straight school lolll
excited for break haha?
For sure
And I can’t leave here at least for the next 10 minutes
I have class starting at 4
Probably not worth coming there then
damn
I have to miss class for a doctor’s appt
I’m free from like 3-4
Cool
If you’re still here this afternoon do you wanna work together
When are you going home for break
/are you done?
What part are you on?
yeah haha
Just kidding LMAO figured it out
I’ve tried everything LMAO
I feel so dumb
The zombie thing
Dude lol what was the loop condition for part 6
appreciate it
I think I got it
Thanks dude
*pipes
Popes
do you have to store the previous file’s file descriptors
*stdin
how do u access the stdout of another process
or did you do that in eval_line
did you do that in run?
let me give that a crack
oh interesting
we didn’t do that so it’s an issue lol
ok that would make sense
do you exit the parent process after forking for background stuff?
We just realized we have a bug from like step 2 maybe?
question
Nice
😤😤
how is it for you?
Milan and I are on step 4
lol probably
The BG tests do
I mean the tests pass I guess
Is that ok/bc other stuff isn’t implemented yet
(not as if you had called echo or something or printed something)
but if you call sleep 1 & it prints the output right on the old shell prompt
hey so I think? it works
*shot loll
Ok let me give that a shit
Ohhh
Ok
How do you know when you get an ‘&’
fuck a linked list lol
tree
feel free to come thru
Milan and I just started in Lowell
For step 2
yo how do you detect control operators
I met with him earlier to review the stuff from the unit
I’m meeting Milan st like 8 to work
Lol
but will let u know soon
idk when specifically
Yeah me and Milan are gonna
I haven’t started it
God damn it lol
Set it to 1
Lol
and I did my pset with him
Milan did his for an hour and it was ok
I can test mine for longer but I think it’s fine
Like 5 minutes
You: 󰀀
I think mine works fine now
I’m happy to talk to you about it lol
Ok lol
I think I forgot a kfree somewhere
idk
I just rewrote fork and it’s good now
Fixed that memory leak lol
Not sure tho
we threw a ptiter in there for the maps (I think)
Uh I think we did?
If forknfails
And after two? (I don’t remember) of the cases in fork
In the free function
*everywhere
Everuwhere
make sure that you’re kfreeing the last page table
yeah I had that too
oh no
You: 󰀀
no place should be systematically empty
but it should be filled up after
When a process is freed
I mean there can be gaps occasionally
like it’s going sequentially
Make sure that it’s filling in physical memory correctly tho
ya
easier to explain in person probably
it’s kind of weird so I’d be happy to walk you through it
good luck on that
Yeah no problem
so u gotta delete that yourself with kfree
ptiter doesn’t traverse the last page table
This took me awhile
oh AND
And note that map also kallocs additional pages implicitly
right
but that’s the basic idea
I can walk you through it in more depth later if you want
but everything else is mostly ok
you should just stop giving it memory and clean up what you’ve given it (if like map fails or something you need to clean up the memory that map gave it)
You shouldn’t kill the process
And it doesn’t work
basically if a process asks for more memory
in the fork case you have to be careful about how much memory you’re freeing
which was wrong
but we just plugged that in everywhere
we had a function that basically did what system - exit was supposed to do
you have to treat it casewise and be a little more careful
it was with being lazy with the third step (like cleaning up if fork screws up and there’s not enough memory)
would be happy to help you at any time
yeah I’m pretty sure my step 7 works
he had a stroke of genius
Milan and I finished it
Does it run for like 30 seconds for you too
exact same thing
yeah haha
it be like that sometimes
I have the red stars rn
LOL
and set the owner to 0
we just decremented a counter for shared pages
what did you do for kfree?
wait we just got a “Unexpected exception 13!”
nah it’s just undefined behavior lol
oh shit
%rip
the operating system just crashes lol
it really is
Yeah I’m on step 7 rn
Oh shit lmao
I’ll let u know if we run in to them
No I don’t think so?
Oh ok will do haha
just figured it out haha thanks my dude
*try
Let me give that a turn
I forgot about the system call part
Uhhh
Oh shit my bad
Varun missed a call from you.
Oh ok haha
I can’t see that function lol
wait where is setpagetable?
no wonder
oh shit I’m doing this completely wrong LOL
do you just have to do the 2 vmiter map for the kernel mappings & then map after the “allocated & map all memory” part & one vmiter.map after the “allocate stack” part
yo I’m a little stuck on step 2
oof
wbu
I started part 1 but am not done
not really haha
I wanna learn from you haha!
rip
yeah pset 4 supposed to be the hardest one right
you definitely have a lot of natural talent
for sure
Hope to repay the favor next pset!
thanks for all your help dude
honestly doesn’t really matter lol
possible haha but not likely
but doesn’t matter I already turned it in hahah
I think I must’ve fed it the wrong flags lol
If we ever get a chance I wanna see what you did with mmap haha
I think it gets the job done
idk it’s probably fine lol
And if I lose it’s like .98 or something like that
oh like 24 beating, 7 losing
yeah I mean it boosted performance
idk I probably did mmap in a bad way or used the wrong flags lol
it’s similar for sequential but the max is like 19x instead of 70x
I’m not sure why
hmm I think mine isn’t as fast
how much faster is your implementation as a whole?
mine isn’t as fast as yours? I think I might’ve done mmap wrong
nvm I figured it out lol
Or is it automatically done when you call munmap in close?
did you have to flush anything
ok haha good to know
or modify io61_flush?
/did you have to modify io61_open-check
Did you run into an error “input file is not seekabke”
for mmap
sorry for all of these questions
hey haha
You’re the man!
Thanks dude
yeah haha ok
that’s so neat
so you map the whole freaking file?
dope haha
I didn’t see that
Oh shit
or is there some special flag for other stuff haha
or whatever we set it as
should we use the length as 4096
in mmap
haha u right
but those typically are like 85-90 or 85-92
yeah because there are A-s as well
in terms of total score not on the midterm I guess haha
Just depends on the professor
sometimes above a 90
normally I think you shoot shoot for like a 92-93 curved
that’s smaht
word
Oh that’s true
as a %?
how much are midterms worth
grade inflation lol
normally stuff is a B+/A- curve
wow that’s actually pretty rough
I figured it out haha
yeah haha sorry I forgot to text u lol
where the out differs on byte 1, line 1
I’m having this error on tears 20 and 21 for random seek order
or the pos - pos%bufsize
should you be lseeking to pos
yo
or something idk
more likely like an 87
I mean yeah
depends
so I’d guess that a 108 raw score (mean) would be curved to like a...89? Maybe like a 91 or something
classes here normally get curved to a B+/A-
but like if you studied you studied you know
I didn’t do well either lol
hahaha you’ll be fine
probably curved at the end but not sure
it be like that sometimes 😩
me too lol and I studied for this
Classes are normally curved to a B+, A-
They probably will haha
lmao word
I know lmao so clutch
are you here big guy?
thanks dude 😩
be there in a few
I will roll there
Ok word
where do you find the code for these tests haha? cat61?
ok word let me change these and lll check
but should it still be slow?
and then it should not “fail” for readc and writec
so we have to change that
thank you haha I was getting so confused why it was only doing 1 byte at a time
ohhh man oh man
that would make sense that those fail then haha
so you need to change those too?
Oh ohhhhh
that makes so much more sense lmao
ohhh
I didn’t use readc and writec
no
I’m so confused haha
I copy and pasted lol?
basically (I had a case to return -1 if the system call in flush doesn’t work)
and if read I just returned 0
and for flush checked the mode and if it was write I did the stuff in the section notes
but returned n (the result of the system call) for fill
I hope so? I just did the same stuff as the section notes
are you free anytime after 6:30?
for some reason if I look at the strace from my implementation it’s calling system calls 1 byte at a time and I’m not sure why ://
ah shit I still am having some trouble
haha hoping chatting with you later will clear this up!!
hmm right which makes sense
when translating from the section notes haha
I’m so confused lol I think I fucked up something with the reads and writes somehow W
I’m just studying in Smith
for sure
fair enough haha
oh
yeah I think I will
sure haha that works great
just lmk when works for you lol I’m just working today
ok word haha
could I meet up with u sometime today for some help haha?
god damn lol
ok word I definitely have an error
seeks
that isn’t supposed to happen right? Or is it because of the seems
Like the out is different from stdio
hey so after doing the write & reads (hopefully like) section, it fails 4 of the tests
ok word
Ohhh
that seems like it’s already implemented maybe? idk? besides change the pos_tag stuff and everything
yo what do we need to do for io61_seek?
I have Ec 1011 midterm tomorrow so gonna do that first lol
exactly none haha
oh ok dope thanks man
just spaces between stuff
hey you space out the arguments in the same way for phase 3 rights
Thanks dude!
yeah that worked
ok I’ll give that a try then
I think the last few are >9 in mine so idk...would hexadecimal be better?
did you have the values comma separated?
hey when you put in the password for phase 2
or make sure that f is well defined
I think you have to overwrite the placeholder
no mine works fine
from what I understand
Anything is ok
Honestly I think that’s fine
The difficulty is you can do anything
Oh for example?
*from_list
and call Array.to_list
but you’re only trying to draw one, but it still works. You can put the tuple in a list
So what you can do is put them in a list
It draws all of the lines in the array
Tuples
I think part of the problem is that the graphics draw segment thing, if I remember correctly, takes int * int * int * int tooled in an array
Including the border
So you need to calculate the height and width
Also remember that the draw method takes in x0 y0 w h
Then draw a rectangle (but don’t call fill for this specific one) on that area (after adding borders to each thing)
yeah so what I did is you search for the list of points for the most extreme x values (min and max) and y values (min and max)
or make sure that f is well defined
I think you have to overwrite the placeholder
no mine works fine
