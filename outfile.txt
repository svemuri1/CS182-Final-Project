no mine works fine
from what I understand
Anything is ok
Honestly I think that’s fine
The difficulty is you can do anything
Oh for example?
*from_list
and call Array.to_list
but you’re only trying to draw one, but it still works. You can put the tuple in a list
So what you can do is put them in a list
It draws all of the lines in the array
Tuples
I think part of the problem is that the graphics draw segment thing, if I remember correctly, takes int * int * int * int tooled in an array
Including the border
So you need to calculate the height and width
Also remember that the draw method takes in x0 y0 w h
Then draw a rectangle (but don’t call fill for this specific one) on that area (after adding borders to each thing)
yeah so what I did is you search for the list of points for the most extreme x values (min and max) and y values (min and max)
or make sure that f is well defined
